              " 'the outbreak of coronavirus in china has led to concerns over a slowdown in the nation’s economy and put pressure on oil and industrial metals prices on bets for potentially weaker demand for the commodities. however, if the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, known as sars, may serve as a guide, the overall impact of the virus outbreak may be modest and short lived on the global economy, as well as on the commodities sector. “even the significant economic disruption related to sars turned out to be temporary and experts expect this disease to be less deadly and better contained,” said jennifer mckeown, head of the global economics service at capital economics, in report dated wednesday. as of midnight tuesday there were 440 confirmed cases of coronavirus in china and at least nine people have died, according to the associated press . cases have also been confirmed in thailand, japan, south korea, the u.s. and taiwan. the sars outbreak roughly 17 years ago saw more than 8,000 cases in 26 countries and killed nearly 800 people. after news of a single coronavirus case diagnosed in the united states emerged tuesday , prices for industrial metals such as silver and copper finished lower. on wednesday, silver us:sih20 prices have moved up a bit to settle at $17.828 an ounce, up 0.1% for the session, though copper us:hgh20 continued its decline, losing 1% to finish at $2.765 a pound. oil prices us:clh20 uk:brnh20 , meanwhile, moved sharply lower wednesday , with some analysts attributing weakness to the possibility that the virus will curb travel and result in less fuel consumption. industrial metals can sell off and test or move below the 2019 lows if china’s coronavirus becomes an epidemic, said chintan karnani, chief market analyst at insignia consultants. the virus will “result in less consumer spending in the short term,” he said. depending on the scope of the spread, “industrial metals can fall between 3% to 5% anytime.” jeff klearman, portfolio manager at exchange-traded fund issuer graniteshares, said that prices for base metals, which copper and zinc, would decline if the coronavirus becomes widespread and weaken global economic growth. he specifically mentioned copper as china accounts for about half of global demand for the metal. crude-oil prices would decline under that scenario as well, as oil touches “almost all phases of the economy,” he said. “a slowdown in industrial production, air travel and gasoline consumption would lead to less demand pitting against ample supply.” but karnani pointed out that a few hundred people getting the disease is “not an epidemic” in the world’s most populous nation. the developments over the next three weeks will be “crucial,” he added. the spread of the virus comes ahead of the lunar new year celebration, which begins on jan. 25 and can last through to the feb. 8 lantern festival. it’s a significant travel period for the chinese, raising the potential for further spread of the illness. “the recent outbreak of a new coronavirus in china has raised questions on its potential impact on the oil and jet fuel markets,” analysts damien courvalin and callum bruce of goldman sachs wrote in research note dated tuesday. “translating the estimated sars demand impact into 2020 volumes” leads to a potential 260,000 barrels per day “negative shock to global oil demand on average,” including a 170,000 barrel-per-day loss of jet fuel demand, the goldman sachs analysts said. these demand concerns will counter worries around supply disruptions in libya, iran and iraq, they added. the total oil demand loss would translate into a modest $2.90 per barrel impact on oil prices, based on goldman sachs pricing model, the analysts said. uncertainty surrounding the sars epidemic had “left market and forecasters initially pricing and assuming a much larger impact than eventually occurred,” they said. oil was down nearly 20% at its trough during that epidemic, but the “elevated level of fear ultimately subsided when the pace of new cases reported slowed, with a total duration of the epidemic outbreak of  5 months, before a quick recovery in regional activity.” given that, many analysts believe the impact from the spread of the coronavirus will be less significant, as well as temporary. for now, the spread of the coronavirus across asia into the u.s. is “clearly a major public health concern,” but capital economics expects that its economic effects will be “modest,” said mckeown. “based on the information we have, we do not expect the coronavirus to have more than a temporary effect on global gdp, which is likely to be made up once the disease is brought under control,” she said. “and while there have already been some effects on financial markets...we suspect that these too will be short-lived.”',\n",
              " 'burberry raised its revenue outlook for the year on wednesday as it reported strong sales in mainland china. but shares fell amid weak hong kong sales and concerns that the emerging coronavirus could present a problem for the british luxury goods retailer. burberry brby, +3.27% , which is known for its trademark checked print trench coats, has been hit by widespread protests in hong kong , where sales halved in the christmas quarter. however, this was partially offset by sales in mainland china, which rose by a “midteens percentage.” the company now expects revenue to march 2020 to increase by a low single-digit percentage at constant exchange rate, compared with previous guidance of broadly stable. retail revenue was up just 2% to £719 million ($939 million) over the 13 weeks to the end of december 2019. comparable-store sales rose 3% in the third quarter. “this was another good quarter as new collections delivered strong growth and we continued to shift consumer perceptions of our brand and align the network to our new creative vision,” chief executive marco gobbetti said in a statement. but investors appeared to brush aside any good news from the trading update, dropping over 2%. the stock has risen 27% over the past year, compared with a 10% hike for the wider ftse 100 ukx, -0.36% , and 20% in the last three months alone. burberry stock was headed for the third-straight day of losses—luxury goods makers across europe have been under pressure this week on concerns about fallout from china’s coronavirus that has killed nine and sickened hundreds. “the strong run the shares have enjoyed in recent months may have prompted some profit-taking and the reminder of how closely the company’s fortunes are tied to china may have provoked some nervousness given the deadly virus which is currently afflicting the country,” said russ mould, investment director at aj bell. “the political disruption in hong kong is also having an impact too,” he added. strong demand for italian designer riccardo tisci’s collection helped deliver double-digit growth year-over-year. new product made up approximately three quarters of the assortment at its stores at the end of the quarter, but was offset by lower markdowns and the tough situation in hong kong. the fashion company, which is in the second year of its transformation plan, said it is putting a focus on elevating its product offering, re-energizing the brand and aligning distribution to its new luxury positioning. it launched its first online game “b-bounce” in october 2019 as a way of trying to appeal to younger, more digital-savvy customers. burberry said it would continue its focus on “inspiring” chinese consumers, and preparations were under way to take its runway show to shanghai in april. the company is also developing its first social retail store in partnership with gaming company tencent 700, -4.84% , which is scheduled to open in shenzhen in the first half of 2021. richard hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said burberry is making some “remarkable progress.” “it has an increasing focus on the chinese consumer, as evidenced by its impending retail tie-up with tencent, in a region where its high-end products are already popular. tourist spend is holding up for the moment, particularly in continental europe, while the riccardo collection not only continues to delight consumers but is also an increasing presence across burberry’s portfolio,” hunter said.',\n",
              " 'medical staff at a hospital in wuhan, china, where most cases of the viral infection have occurred. credit: getty the world is racing to learn more about the outbreak of a new viral infection that was first detected in wuhan, china, last month and is causing increasing alarm around the world. as nature went to press, officials in china had confirmed more than 4,500 cases of the virus, which causes a respiratory illness, and some 100 deaths. around 50 cases had also been confirmed in other countries, in asia, the united states and europe. china virus: latest news on spreading infection researchers fear similarities to the 2002–03 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), which emerged in southern china and killed 774 people in 37 countries. both are members of a large virus family, called coronaviruses, that also includes viruses responsible for the common cold. china has taken unprecedented action to try to halt the outbreak — including putting wuhan and nearby cities on ‘lockdown’, restricting travel in and out of the cities. for now, the world health organization (who) has held off declaring a public-health emergency of international concern — the agency’s highest level of alarm — after a meeting of officials last week, but that could change. nature rounds up the questions at the heart of scientists’ efforts to understand the virus. how does the virus spread? this is the most urgent question surrounding the outbreak. chinese authorities have confirmed that it spreads from person to person after identifying clusters of cases among families, as well as transmission from patients to health-care workers. monitoring the rate at which new cases appear, and when symptoms began for each case, should reveal how easily the virus passes between humans and whether the outbreak has the potential to persist. one figure that epidemiologists want is the number of people that someone with the virus tends to infect — known as r 0 . an r 0 of more than 1 means that countermeasures, such as quarantine, will be needed to contain the spread. the who last week published an estimated r 0 of 1.4–2.5. other teams suggest slightly higher values 1 , 2 . these estimates are similar to the r 0 of sars during the early stages of the 2002–03 outbreak, and of the novel strain of h1n1 influenza that caused a pandemic in 2009. but they are higher than r 0 values estimated during outbreaks of the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) virus, a coronavirus similar to sars. “now it’s in the range of these other important epidemics, and that indicates the potential that it will cause a similar scale of public-health concern if nothing else happens,” says mark woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the university of edinburgh, uk. but researchers caution that r 0 estimates come with large uncertainties because of gaps in the data, and the assumptions used to calculate the figure. they also point out that the r 0 is a moving target and that estimates of the figure change over the course of an outbreak — as control measures are implemented. in the coming days, health authorities and researchers will be looking for signs that the travel restrictions in wuhan and other chinese cities, and other steps taken by to stem transmission, have reduced the r 0 there. can infected people spread the virus without showing symptoms? another major unanswered question is whether — and how extensively — people without symptoms can infect others. a study 3 of a cluster of six infections in a family in shenzhen identified a child who was infected with the virus but showed no symptoms. if such asymptomatic cases are common and these individuals can spread the virus, then containing its spread will be much more difficult, researchers say. key to controlling the sars virus was the fact that few cases were asymptomatic. “defining the scale of asymptomatic transmission remains key: if this is a rare event then its impact should be minimal in terms of the overall outbreak,” jonathan ball, a virologist at the university of nottingham, uk, said in a statement distributed by the uk science media centre. “but, if this transmission mode is contributing significantly then control becomes increasingly difficult.” stop the wuhan virus one way to determine whether symptom-free people can spread the virus would be to study its spread in individual households in china, says sheila bird, a biostatistician at the university of cambridge, uk. by monitoring all the members of a household in which one person is infected, it should be possible to determine who else contracts the virus and how. such studies would also be helpful for identifying ways of stopping spread in households, bird adds. raina macintyre, an epidemiologist at the university of new south wales in sydney, australia, says that although the rise in cases probably reflects an increase in testing for and detecting the virus, the dramatic jump is concerning. “it’s very much a dynamic picture, and until we have an indication that cases are declining, it’s going to continue to be of concern,” she says. but macintyre also notes that researchers are struggling to accurately model the outbreak, and to predict how it might unfold, because the case-report data being released by chinese authorities are incomplete. “what we need to identify is when people got sick, not when the cases were reported, and all we’ve seen so far is when the cases were reported.” how deadly is the virus? high rates of pneumonia among the first people infected had many researchers worried that the wuhan virus was especially pernicious. those concerns have receded slightly, as more mild cases have turned up. with some 100 deaths in more than 4,500 reported cases, the virus does not seem to be as deadly as sars — which killed around 10% of the people it infected. but “it’s too early to be sanguine about the severity”, says neil ferguson, a mathematical epidemiologist at imperial college london. where did the virus come from? authorities are working on the theory that the virus originated in an unidentified animal or animals, and spread to humans at an animal and seafood market in wuhan, which is now closed. identification of the animal source of the virus could help officials to control the current outbreak and gauge its threat — and potentially prevent future epidemics, say researchers. genetic sequencing suggests that the wuhan virus is related to coronaviruses that circulate in bats , including sars and its close relatives. but other mammals can transmit these viruses — sars was probably spread to humans by civet cats. how quickly does the wuhan virus spread? the market in wuhan also sells wild animals. and in a controversial study 4 published last week, a team of researchers in china who had performed a genetic analysis suggested that the virus jumped to humans from snakes. but other scientists were sceptical of the study, and said that there is no proof that viruses such as those behind the outbreak can infect species other than mammals and birds. “nothing supports snakes being involved,” says david robertson, a virologist at the university of glasgow, uk. many researchers think that the animal host or hosts of the virus won’t be identified without further field and laboratory work. and many hope that genetic tests of animals or environmental sources will turn up clues. a mammal is the most likely candidate, says cui jie, a virologist at the pasteur institute of shanghai who was part of a team that identified sars-related viruses in bats from a cave in yunnan province in southwestern china in 2017. sars and the new virus are part of a subgroup known as betacoronaviruses. fieldwork in the wake of the sars outbreak has found such viruses only in mammals, cui says. what can we learn from the virus’s genetic sequence? genetic sequencing of the wuhan coronavirus offers clues to its origins and spread. labs in china and thailand have sequenced the genomes of more than 20 strains found in infected people and have made them publicly available. that’s “pretty remarkable”, says trevor bedford, an evolutionary geneticist at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle, washington, who is analysing the sequences as they come in . “people are extremely fast and excellent about data sharing,” he adds. bedford and other geneticists are using the data to determine when the virus emerged — current estimates point to november 2019. viral sequences, bedford adds, could identify any genetic changes that might have helped the virus make the jump from animals to humans. and if there is extensive human-to-human transmission, bedford and other geneticists will be looking for signs that the virus has gained further mutations that are enabling it to spread more efficiently in humans. bedford cautions that any conclusions are preliminary, because so few data are available. “adding a few key samples can change the story significantly,” he says. can a drug be developed to treat the coronavirus? no drugs have been shown to be effective in treating sars or other coronavirus infections in humans, and no vaccines aimed at preventing these infections have been licensed. a team at china’s national engineering research center for the emergence drugs in beijing is working on finding therapies that would work by blocking the receptor on human cells that the virus latches on to and uses to infect the cells. a comparison of the sars and new china virus sequences , published on 16 january, found that they probably bind to the same receptor. the team is hoping to revive efforts to develop treatments for sars and adapt them in a bid to develop a drug that could work against the latest virus. another researcher who has been developing drugs for coronaviruses since the sars outbreak is hoping to test drug candidates in animal models of the wuhan virus . chinese authorities are also testing whether existing hiv drugs can treat the infection. ritonavir and liponavir, which are approved to treat hiv, are being given to people with pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, according to media reports and a 26 january statement by the beijing branch of china’s national health commission.',\n",

              " 'as human cases rise in amysterious viral outbreak that originated in china, scientists are rushing to identify the animals, where they suspect the epidemic began. in a controversial study published last night, a team of researchers in china claimed to have an answer: snakes. but other scientists say there is no proof that viruses such as those behind the outbreak can infect species other than mammals and birds. “nothing supports snakes being involved,” says david robertson, a virologist at the university of glasgow, uk. the pathogen responsible for the outbreak belongs to a large family called coronaviruses, which includes the viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), as well as those behind the common cold. the latest virus—currently known as 2019-ncov—is most closely related to sars and related viruses that circulate in bats. but these can also infect other animals that can pass the virus to humans. many scientists suspect that an unknown animal carrying 2019-ncov spread the virus to humans at a live seafood and wild animal market in wuhan, where the first cases were documented in december. “the intermediate host is the missing piece of the puzzle: how have all these people got infected?” says robertson. a team led by wei ji, a microbiologist at peking university health science center school of basic medical sciences in beijing, looked for a sign that 2019-ncov had adapted to any specific animal host. most amino acids are encoded by multiple codons—sequences of three dna or rna nucleotide triplets that encode amino acids. one way that viruses adapt is by encoding proteins using the same choice of codons as their host. wei’s team compared the codons favoured by 2019-ncov with those preferred by potential hosts including hedgehogs, pangolins, bats, chickens, humans and snakes. the team reported that 2019-ncov’s choice of codons was most similar to those used by two snakes:bungarus multicinctus(the many-banded krait) andnaja atra(the chinese cobra). snakes were sold at the wuhan seafood and animal market, the researchers note. “taken together, snakes could be the most likely wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-ncov,” they write in a paper published on 22 january in thejournal of medical virology. robertson says it’s unlikely that 2019-ncov has infected any secondary animal host for long enough to alter its genome significantly. “it takes a long time for such a process to play out,” he says. “they have no evidence snakes can be infected by this new coronavirus and serve as a host for it,” says paulo eduardo brandão, a virologist at the university of são paulo who is investigating whether coronaviruses can infect snakes at all. “there’s no consistent evidence of coronaviruses in hosts other than mammals and aves (birds).” wei’s team has not yet responded to e-mails fromnature’s news team seeking comment on the paper and the criticism it has received. many researchers are sceptical that the animal host or hosts of 2019-ncov can be identified without further field and laboratory work. many hope that genetic tests of animals or environmental sources, such as cages and containers, from the wuhan market will turn up clues. a mammal is the most likely candidate, says cui jie, a virologist at the pasteur institute of shanghai who was part of a team thatidentified sars-related viruses in batsfrom a cave in yunnan province in southwestern china in 2017. sars and 2019-ncov are part of a virus subgroup known as betacoronaviruses. fieldwork in the wake of the 2002–03 sars outbreak has found such viruses only in mammals, cui says. “clearly this 2019-ncov is a mammalian virus.” this article is reproduced with permission and wasfirst publishedon january 23 2020.',\n",

chinese cities, people will travel in their hundreds of millions to celebrate with family as the calendar ticks over to the “year of the rat” on january 25.the upcoming shunian, or “rat year” has proven to be something of a boom for the walt disney company, with its endearing rodent mascot representing a safe way for brands of all price-points across the fashion, beauty and accessories sectors to give a nod to the new year – and to traditional chinese culture, without being too serious or controversial.“in china, we have been preparing for the ‘year of the mouse’ for the last three years,” kermid rahman, vice president and general manager for consumer products commercialisation at the walt disney company, greater china and korea, explained. though the chinese term shunian is generally

crescendo in august that saw brands from versace, to givenchy and coach, lose chinese celebrity ambassadors who quit in protest following the release of products considered offensive for labelling

a disney collaboration might diminish the positioning of a luxury brand, jason yu says that on the contrary it helps brands connect with younger consumers, a key demographic for international luxury companies.according to a 2019 report from mckinsey, china’s post-80s consumers (the first generation in china to grow up with mickey mouse, following the reform and opening period of the late-70s) account for more than half of the total luxury spend by chinese consumers; the post-90s generation, meanwhile, are the fastest growing luxury consumer cohort in china.“for younger consumers mickey mouse is going to be a very popular choice,” yu said. “i would say that all the luxury brands are trying to launch products that are appealing to younger consumers, rather than the classic luxury consumer target.”interestingly, these age groups have also been targeted by the walt disney company in china, with a shift from products targeting children to those targeting young adults in recent years.“currently, 55 percent of disney consumer products are purchased by young adults and 45 percent are by children. ten years ago, the ratio for adults and children was 15 percent and 85 percent respectively,” disney’s rahman said.there’s little doubt the safe haven of cuteness and universal appeal of disney’s favourite mouse has won chinese new year in 2020. although there’s not much in the way of innovative campaigns breaking through the noise this season, perhaps brands are happy to just keep their heads down and avoid attracting attention for the wrong reasons.additional reporting

because china’s domestic market is so big that many brands are simply not motivated to make a global expansion. marketing to western audiences is another challenge which requires brands to help

from people’s concern over the virus. taobao has issued a notice to all merchants selling masks on its platform that it will not allow price increases. at present, they say, the supply of masks on taobao and tmall “is sufficient.”(36kr)china decoded wants to hear from you. send tips, suggestions, complaints and compliments to our shanghai-based asia correspondentcasey.hall@businessoffashion.com. china’s 1.4 billion people are gearing up for the biggest holiday of the year, with an official week-long holiday beginning january 24, the eve of the lunar new year. despite concerns about the deadly coronavirus that has spread from wuhan to other major chinese cities, people will travel in their hundreds of millions to celebrate with family as the calendar ticks over to the “year of the rat” on january 25. the upcoming shunian, or “rat year” has proven to be something of a boom for the walt disney company, with its endearing rodent mascot representing a safe way for brands of all price-points across the fashion, beauty and accessories sectors to give a nod to the new year – and to traditional chinese culture, without being too serious or controversial. “in china, we have been preparing for the ‘year of the mouse’ for the last three years,” kermid rahman, vice president and general manager for consumer products commercialisation at the walt disney company, greater china and korea, explained. though the chinese term shunian is generally translated as “year of the rat”, the word shu actually means rat and mouse interchangeably. li ning x mickey mouse campaign 2020 | source: courtesy “our china-based creative team integrated chinese elements into mickey and minnie product style guides in a locally relevant way. they developed approximately 20,000 sku localised products for the chinese lunar new year,” rahman added. in addition to uniqlo, gap and gucci plugging their mickey collaborations in the lead-up to spring festival, other domestic and international fashion and sportswear brands feature limited edition chinese new year products with disney’s mickey and minnie mouse characters, including columbia, li ning, adidas, urban revivo, chocoolate, vero moda, peacebird, zhang dayi and metersbonwe. in the beauty sector, innisfree, sk-ii, neutrogena, dr jart+, elizabeth arden and maybelline also have mickey-related chinese new year products; and pandora and chow tai fook are releasing mickey mouse accessories as part of their holiday offerings. “in china, we not only work with global high-end brands, but we work with more than 450 local licensee partners…  better products, greater innovation and happiness to more chinese consumers,” rahman added. as an aesthetic proposition, the year of the rat presents inherent challenges, as opposed to, for example, the year of the dragon or horse, animals that are more easily rendered in a visually appealing way. this makes mickey an enticing choice, but perhaps more important than looking good, mickey is also a safe choice. throughout their history of doing business in china and interacting with local holidays, chinese new year collaborations have notoriously been hit and miss for global brands with numerous missteps being seized upon by chinese netizens for ridicule. in 2019, burberry bore the brunt of criticism with its campaign depicting unsmiling, unconventional family portraits that were widely labelled “creepy” by chinese consumers. i think after a number of cultural shocks... all of the international brands are trying to be safer. criticism of international luxury brands from chinese consumers was something of a theme throughout 2019, with a crescendo in august that saw brands from versace, to givenchy and coach, lose chinese celebrity ambassadors who quit in protest following the release of products considered offensive for labelling taiwan and hong kong as countries separate from china. this trend has seemingly made international brands even more gun shy when it comes to chinese new year products and campaigns in 2020, according to jason yu, the shanghai-based general manager of market research firm kantar worldpanel. “i think after a number of cultural shocks and very expensive lessons learned last year, all of the international brands are trying to be safer,” he said. however, not everyone has been won over by the mickey mouse collections, particularly at the luxury end of the fashion spectrum. one of wechat’s top-ranked fashion accounts, iiiher, penned an article that was particularly critical of gucci’s collaboration, ridiculing the cost of 30 to 40 thousand yuan ($4,350 to $5,800) products and comparing them to similar products available from fast fashion brands and taobao stores for a fraction of the price. gucci’s collection has received plenty of coverage within china, largely because of its co-operation with high-profile kols such as mr bags and fil xiaobai, who along with celebrity ambassador ni ni were filmed enjoying disneyland with their families wearing the collection, vlogs that were then pushed out on weibo. gucci chinese new year 2020 campaign | source: courtesy mr bags, whose real name is tao liang, told bof that gucci in particular had been paying attention to the growth in influence that kols have enjoyed in china over the past year, with as many as 48

              " 'chinese authorities have encouraged people in the city of wuhan to wear surgical masks in public to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus. the question is: do they work? many infectious disease specialists say the cheap disposable masks, which cover the nose and mouth, may help prevent the spread of infections if they are worn properly and used consistently. but there isn’t much high-quality scientific evidence on their effectiveness outside health care settings, experts say. most of the best studies, which are randomized controlled trials, focused on how well surgical masks protect health care workers in hospitals from picking up infections from sick patients, and found that consistent use of them helped. dr. julie vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee for the infectious diseases society of america, said surgical masks are really “the last line of defense.” “we worry about people feeling they’re getting more protection from the mask than they really are,” she said. “washing your hands and avoiding people who are ill is way more important than wearing a mask.” because surgical masks aren’t fitted or sealed, they leave gaps around the mouth, “so you’re not filtering all of the air that comes in,” she said. the masks will, however, block most large respiratory droplets from other people’s sneezes and coughs from entering your mouth and nose, said dr. amesh adalja, an infectious disease physician at the johns hopkins center for health security. coronaviruses are primarily spread through droplets, he said. the bigger problem is that people don’t use the masks properly. “most people will put their hand underneath the mask to scratch their face or rub their nose,” bringing contaminants in contact with the nose and mouth, said dr. adalja. “you can’t take it off when you get a phone call.” dr. mark loeb, an infectious disease specialist at mcmaster university in hamilton, ontario, said a study during an outbreak of the sars coronavirus found that any type of protection — whether a mask or a respirator — reduced the risk of infections in health care workers by about 85 percent. “the most important message was that the risk was lower if they consistently used any mask,” he said.  there is general agreement that infected patients who wear surgical masks are less likely to spread infection to others. the centers for disease control and prevention has instructed hospitals to ask any patients who have a fever or respiratory illness, have recently traveled to wuhan, or have come in contact with someone who has traveled there, to wear a surgical mask. the c.d.c. also recommends that health care workers wear a respirator, which filters out more particles than a mask, when they are around such patients. the risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus in the united states — where there is only one confirmed case — is “way too low to start wearing a face mask,” said dr. peter rabinowitz, who is co-director of the university of washington metacenter for pandemic preparedness and global health security. but washing hands — frequently and before eating — is universally recommended. hand sanitizer is effective against respiratory viruses. experts also recommend washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, rubbing the hands together and ensuring all parts of the hands — the palms as well as the back of the hands — are washed. “it’s also important to keep your hands away from your face,” said dr. vaishampayan. “respiratory viruses don’t infect through your skin, they infect through your mucous membranes: the eyes, nose and mouth.”',\n",

              " 'u.s. gasoline futures are down 7% this year. photograph by david paul morris/bloomberg gasoline prices have been falling this year, and they could continue to decline as coronavirus puts a damper on china’s lunar new year festivities . people are less likely to travel throughout china given the spread of the virus, which has killed at least 17 people. travel centered around the holiday is considered the largest annual human migration in the world . an estimated 3 billion trips take place over 40 days. the potential reduction in traffic means less fuel is burned, potentially cutting into chinese demand for imported crude oil and petroleum products. and it comes as other factors weigh on gasoline prices. the latest inventory data in the u.s. shows that supplies are building up even as demand remains subdued. the supply-demand imbalance comes as speculators have bet that gasoline supplies will tighten as a result of high demand this summer, notes goldman sachs analyst damien courvalin . supplies of gasoline are likely to remain high because more refineries will be in operation and available to produce the fuel. last year, refineries were out of action longer than usual for maintenance, and that isn’t likely to be repeated this year. “ultimately, the main headwind for gasoline (and distillates) this year will come from high available refining capacity,” courvalin wrote. all of this is good news for u.s. drivers, who are paying less at the pump and may continue to see low prices over the coming weeks. the average national gasoline price is $2.57 per gallon, according to the u.s. energy information administration . gasoline futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange are down 7% this year, while the s&p 500 is up 2.8%. “with oil prices sagging lately, the door has been opened for a notable decline in u.s. gasoline prices, and that’s exactly what has happened, with more declines likely coming ahead of us before the fun is over,” said patrick dehaan , head of petroleum analysis for gasbuddy , which tracks the gasoline market for consumers. not only are oil prices weak overall, but “demand for gasoline remains abysmal and the fuel being produced today will have to eventually be purged from the system over the next few months as refiners begin the transition to summer gasoline,” he added. write to avi salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com',\n",

              " 'wuhan may not be a well-known chinese mega-city like beijing or shanghai. but the place where the coronavirus outbreak emerged is, in fact, a crowded metropolis with connections to every part of the globe. estimates vary on the exact size of the population, with local government officials putting the figure at 11 million, though un data from 2018 says 8.9 million people live in the central chinese city. either way, the city is around the same size as london, but much bigger than washington dc. one estimate makes it the 42nd biggest city in the world, and the seventh biggest in china. and it\\'s the size - and economic clout - of wuhan that explains why the virus has travelled quickly across asia, and even to the us. in short, the virus has spread so widely because lots of people visit wuhan and take the virus home with them. wuhan international airport handled 20 million passengers in 2016, and offers direct flights to london, paris, dubai, and other cities around the world. the city is built along the yangtze river and, according to its website, it is a \"foundation of in both hi-tech manufacturing and traditional manufacturing\". it has a series of industrial zones, 52 \"institutions of higher learning\", and claims more than 700,000 students - including, reportedly, the largest number of undergraduates in the country. some 230 of the world\\'s 500 biggest companies (as measured by the fortune global list) have invested there. there is also notable investment from france - which had a foreign concession in hankou, in today\\'s wuhan, between 1886 and 1943. more than 100 french firms have invested in the city and peugeot-citroen has a chinese joint-venture plant there. wuhan can also serve as a gateway to the three gorges - a tourist region and home to a huge hydroelectric dam. so, although the coronavirus originated in a local seafood market, the flow of people in and out of wuhan has ensured its spread. the us patient, for example, had recently visited wuhan, as had both japanese patients. the korean patient lived there. the case in thailand is a chinese tourist from wuhan. the huge flow of people in and out of wuhan will only increase as chinese new year approaches, and millions of people return home to celebrate. china\\'s national health commission said travellers should avoid wuhan, and that wuhan residents should not leave the city. but wuhan\\'s status as one of the biggest - and most connected - places in the world means international cases will almost certainly continue to emerge.',\n",
              " 'one of the abiding images of any virus outbreak is people in surgical masks. using them to prevent infection is popular in many countries around the world, most notably china during the current coronavirus outbreak where they are also worn to protect against high pollution levels. virologists are sceptical about their effectiveness against airborne viruses. but there is some evidence to suggest the masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions. surgical masks were first introduced into hospitals in the late 18th century but they did not make the transition into public use until the spanish flu outbreak in 1919 that went on to kill over 50 million people. dr david carrington, of st george\\'s, university of london, told bbc news \"routine surgical masks for the public are not an effective protection against viruses or bacteria carried in the air\", which was how \"most viruses\" were transmitted, because they were too loose, had no air filter and left the eyes exposed. but they could help lower the risk of contracting a virus through the \"splash\" from a sneeze or a cough and provide some protection against hand-to-mouth transmissions. a 2016 study from new south wales suggested people touched their faces about 23 times an hour. jonathan ball, professor of molecular virology at the university of nottingham, said: \"in one well controlled study in a hospital setting, the face mask was as good at preventing influenza infection as a purpose-made respirator.\" respirators, which tend to feature a specialised air filter, are specifically designed to protect against potentially hazardous airborne particles. \"however, when you move to studies looking at their effectiveness in the general population, the data is less compelling - it\\'s quite a challenge to keep a mask on for prolonged periods of time,\" prof ball added. dr connor bamford, of the wellcome-wolfson institute for experimental medicine, at queen\\'s university belfast, said \"implementing simple hygiene measures\" was vastly more effective. \"covering your mouth while sneezing, washing your hands, and not putting your hands to your mouth before washing them, could help limit the risk of catching any respiratory virus,\" he said. the nhs says the best way to avoid catching viruses such as flu is to: dr jake dunning, head of emerging infections and zoonoses at public health england, said: \"although there is a perception that the wearing of facemasks may be beneficial, there is in fact very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use outside of these clinical setting.\" he said masks had to be worn correctly, changed frequently and got rid of safely if they were to work properly. \"research also shows that compliance with these recommended behaviours reduces over time when wearing facemasks for prolonged periods,\" he added. people would be better to focus on good personal and hand hygiene if they are concerned, dr dunning said.',\n",

barometer for china’s consumption, a poor performance during this chinese new year season will not bode well for the country’s economy in the year ahead. swiss bank ubs said the coronavirus outbreak could present some downside risk to its economic growth forecast for the mainland, but predicted that beijing would likely engage in additional policy easing to offset any shock from the virus, particularly to affected sectors, including retail. analysts have been looking to past outbreaks, such as sars, for signs of how china’s economy and retail sales might be impacted by this latest health scare. sars resulted in 774 deaths around the world from november 2002 through july 2003, with most of the deaths in mainland china and hong kong. “history does not repeat itself, but it rhymes. more importantly, china has learnt lessons from sars. the government is now working much more proactively and transparently to contain the wuhan pneumonia than  sars, and china’s public health system is now more experienced than before as well,” wang tao, head of asia economic research and chief china economist in ubs’s investment bank, wrote in a research note on wednesday. one potential silver lining for retail sales might be found online, according to kinger lau, chief china equities strategist at goldman sachs, who said the highly-developed e-commerce sector in china means people can continue to spend money, even if they aren’t leaving their homes to do so. the hong kong-listed shares of chinese e-commerce giant alibaba climbed 1.8 percent on wednesday, beating a 1.2 percent gain for hong kong’s hang seng index. how the epidemic will impact shanghai fashion week and other events planned in china in the weeks and months to come remains unclear. so far, most industry leaders appear to be in a wait-and-see mode until people return to work after the spring festival holiday ends. stay tuned to bof updates on this developing story. related articles: luxury stocks hit

              " 'afp via getty images 10:10 a.m. the stock market is sinking thursday morning, and china’s coronavirus , which is spreading globally, is getting the blame. the real reason, however, may simply be that stocks needed a breather. the dow jones industrial average has dropped 107.25 points, or 0.4%, to 29,079.02, while the s&p 500 has declined 0.3% to 3310.33, and the nasdaq composite has dipped 0.1% to 9373.37. it’s easy to see why the coronavirus would get the blame. china has sealed off multiple cities to try to rein in the disease, and there’s even suggestions that macau’s casinos, run by wynn resorts (wynn), las vegas sands (lvs) and mgm resorts (mgm), among others, could be closed . this all comes as china is set to celebrate its new year on jan. 25. chinese stocks are getting walloped —the shanghai composite index dropped 2.8% to 2976.53 thursday—and that makes sense. the spread of coronavirus will have a non-negligible economic impact on the world’s second largest economy. the impact in the u.s., however, should be trivial, especially with china doing its best to contain the virus. still, the market was ready to drop, and the coronavirus presents a perfect excuse. as we noted in the trader column in this past week’s issue of barron’s , the stock market really has melted up—the 10-day moving average was more than 9.25% above the 200-day—and was set for a pullback. right on schedule, the coronavirus starts making headlines, and the market pulls back, if only just a little best. our column also predicted that the dow would eventually hit 30,000, which really isn’t that far away. it will probably go higher too, if history is the judge. but that doesn’t mean everything is ok. market’s can rally right into trouble, and perhaps that’s what is happening now. just don’t expect the current pullback to be the big one. write to ben levisohn at ben.levisohn@barrons.com',\n",
              " 'the world health organization (who) said today that it’s too early to declare an international public health emergency in response to the rapid spread of a new coronavirus from china. the virus is in the same viral family as sars, which circulated throughout the world in 2002 and 2003. there are currently over 500 confirmed cases in five countries of the virus, which causes fever and respiratory distress, and 17 confirmed deaths, according to data cited during the press conference. other sources have reported over 650 confirmed cases and 18 deaths. “make no mistake, this is, though, an emergency in china. but it has not yet become a global health emergency. it may yet become one,” said tedros adhanom, director general of the who, in a press conference today. “the fact that i’m not declaring a  today should not be taken as a sign that the who does not think the situation is serious or is not taking it seriously.” the virus poses a high risk within china and globally, he said. the who defines a global emergency, formally known as a public health emergency of international concern (pheic), as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.” the process for declaring this kind of emergency was put in place after the sars outbreak. five have been declared in the past decade: swine flu (2009), ebola outbreaks in west africa (2014) and the democratic republic of the congo (2019), zika (2016), and polio (2014). the international health regulations committee, which examines evidence around outbreaks and recommends if they should be declared pheics, first met yesterday. the committee was split fifty-fifty and could not reach a decision. committee members were split down the same lines today. those who do not believe that the outbreak has reached the level of a pheic cited the limited number of cases abroad and the aggressive efforts of chinese officials to contain the virus, said committee chair didier houssin during the press conference. “declaring pheic is an important step in the history of an epidemic,” houssin said. “the perception of this declaration by the international community and in the most affected country for the people who are presently struggling with the virus certainly has to be considered.” the who said that every country should be prepared to deal with cases of the virus. it is not recommending any additional restrictions on travel or trade.

              " 'each evening, under cover of darkness, hundreds of live pigs from farms across china are trucked through the rusting gates of a cluster of mildew-stained quarantine and inspection buildings in the qingshuihe logistics zone in shenzhen. overnight they are checked for illness, primarily the african swine fever (asf) that is expected to kill off a quarter of the world’s pigs, and reloaded on to ventilated trucks with dual mainland china and hong kong licence plates. this week the guardian’s animals farmed series is focusing on the global live animal export trade, which, despite welfare and disease concerns, has quadrupled over the last fifty years. nearly 2 billion animals a year are loaded onto trucks or ships and sent off to new countries on journeys that can take weeks. every day at least 5 million creatures are in transit, in a secretive global trade in live farm animals. and those numbers are just the cross-border journeys. they do not include long journeys within countries, which are becoming more frequent due to a trend that has seen smaller slaughterhouses close down. we’re taking a moment to focus on some of the implications of this global trade. before sunrise the caravan makes its way five-and-a-half miles south to the border at man kam to, a small customs and immigration checkpoint, where the pigs go through further visual health checks before crossing into hong kong. they are bound for sheung shui slaughterhouse, the largest of three abattoirs in the territory. once there they will be checked again before being dispatched in less than 24 hours under new rules meant to prevent the spread of asf. it’s a lot of effort to get fresh meat from the 1,400 pigs that cross the border each day. for various reasons, the chinese prefer freshly slaughtered pig, chicken and beef over chilled or frozen meat that has been slaughtered before being shipped. that desire is at the heart of why diseases such as avian flu in poultry and asf have been so difficult to eradicate, with huge movements of live animals from all over the country – from farm to slaughterhouse to market – on a daily basis making controlling the spread of disease incredibly difficult.a recent coronavirus outbreak in china has been linked to a wet market in wuhan, eastern china. like other respiratory illnesses, the disease was initially transmitted from animal to human, but is now being passed human to human. at the nearby walmart, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market. but despite awareness of the issues, the markets are a huge part of chinese life. on a busy morning at a so-called “wet market” in the shajing area, the oldest inhabited and very cantonese part of shenzhen, hundreds of shoppers arrive soon after daybreak. slabs of pork hang from the stalls and various cuts are piled on the counters amid lights with a reddish glare and the occasional buzzing of flies. just a few minutes away at the nearby walmart, where there are also options for fresh, chilled and frozen meat, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market. it has your average western supermarket vibe – white daylight lighting, sterile and clean. staff at the meat counter in walmart and at the stalls in the wet market both say the meat comes in from the same slaughterhouse around 2am. so why the huge difference in foot traffic? molly maj, a corporate communications representative for walmart, says “the average customer in china still prefers fresh meat” over other options. one reason for the demand for wet markets is that widespread refrigeration only came to china in recent years. while most urban homes now have refrigerators, many in rural areas and low income urban renters still do not own one, or only a mini-fridge if they do. the habit of buying perishable food for daily use is still prevalent in many consumers, particularly older shoppers who grew up without refrigerators. they say they can tell the quality of fresh meat by its smell, colour and how it feels to the touch. “when i’m talking with my students i say: ‘the term warm meat, fresh meat, sounds disgusting to me, i grew up  with chilled meat, that’s all i know,” dirk pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine at city university in hong kong and an expert on diseases related to animal husbandry, says. “so i ask them why and they come up with all sorts of vague things like the soup tastes better or that it is a trust issue, knowing it is a live animal at the other end and not some diseased animal,” he says. “it’s all very subjective.” wet markets are central to the perception that fresh meat is better, says pfeiffer. they evoke nostalgia among shoppers, many of whom come from rural areas where all they knew were wet markets and no refrigeration. where a wet market feels familiar a supermarket can seem alien and out of place. “i actually believe that it is an important thing for the older generation to go to the wet market and chat,” says pfeiffer. however, the way the animal trade operates in china is “an utter disaster”, for animal disease and welfare, he adds. a year ago, before rising concerns about the spread of asf, nearly 4,000 pigs crossed daily with less scrutiny. pigs were held in dismal conditions for as long as five days before being slaughtered on the hong kong side, greatly enhancing the possibility of disease transmission, says pfeiffer.the recent shortages due to the asf outbreak have doubled and tripled prices for fresh pork at wet markets across hong kong. farms in hong kong itself can usually supply about 300 pigs a day. land use and environmental restrictions prevent any increase in production. the result is further worries about hong kong’s reliance on mainland china beyond its water and energy dependence. “many years ago, we had imports from all over asia of live animals, but eventually the entire supply was monopolised by mainland china,” said helena wong, a member of hong kong’s legislative council panel on food safety and environmental hygiene. “they killed all their competitors and monopolised the supply of live pig and chicken.” more than 6,000 pigs at the sheung shui slaughterhouse were culled in may 2019 after asf was found among animals brought in from china. hong kong’s legislative council is now trying to figure out how much it owes traders and farmers in compensation. massive culls of poultry due to avian flu in imported mainland chickens in the last decade also led to large compensation bills and, eventually, to ending live chicken imports in early 2016. “we as taxpayers have to give that money,” said wong. “so now we are in a big crisis because in the past few years we have experienced avian flu and now african swine fever.” disease outbreaks have raised wider questions about the sustainability of chinese consumers’ appetite – both on the mainland and in hong kong – for what is often called “warm” meat.for deborah cao, a professor at griffith university in australia and an expert on animal protection in china, a deeper issue driving the live animal trade is a cultural disconnect about animal welfare. “the main problem is the indifference or perception of people who simply regard animals as food, tools, or as things that people can do anything they want to,” she said. “in particular, there is no perception of farm animals as having feelings, or being capable of feeling pain or suffering.” hong kong may find it difficult to switch to a different model. there is almost no chance of farm expansion to support larger scale production within hong kong and, although the government is looking at possibilities of live imports from other asian countries, the ports do not have adequate facilities to cope with large numbers. “to a large extent, if we insist on fresh food, we have to rely on china,” said wong. “if we can change and make certain concessions, hong kong has always been an open market for importing food items from many parts of the world. it is only for the provision of live animals that we are monopolised by the mainland farms.” reporting assistance from zhong yunfan.',\n",
              " 'more than a dozen people in the uk have been tested for coronavirus, as the health secretary warned there is an “increased likelihood” of cases occurring. fourteen people were tested for the virus, with five confirmed negative and nine still awaiting results, public health england (phe) said on thursday night. the scottish government had earlier confirmed that five people were being examined after presenting with symptoms of the illness, while it was understood that another patient was being tested at belfast’s royal victoria hospital. phe would not give a breakdown of where the people were tested and where the negative results were recorded. downing street said four of the suspected cases in scotland were believed to involve chinese nationals. around the world, so far the disease has killed 26 people and infected more than 800. cases have been reported in the us, japan, south korea, thailand, singapore and hong kong. however the world health organization’s emergency committee said on thursday that it was “too early” to declare an international public health emergency over the outbreak. dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, the director-general of the who, said: “make no mistake. this is an emergency in china. but it has not yet become a global health emergency. it may yet become one. “i wish to reiterate, the fact that i am not declaring a public health emergency of international concern today should not be taken as a sign that who does not think the situation is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously. nothing could be further from the truth. who is following this outbreak every minute of every day.” referring to the scottish cases, prof jürgen haas, the head of infection medicine at the university of edinburgh, said he believed there would be many more in other parts of the uk. the scottish patients all travelled from wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, within the past two weeks and were showing symptoms of respiratory trouble – a red flag for the virus. a scottish government spokesman said: “following travel to wuhan, china, two people confirmed as diagnosed with influenza are now being tested for wuhan novel coronavirus as a precautionary measure only. three further people are also undergoing testing on a similar precautionary basis.” haas said there were “robust arrangements” in place to manage emerging diseases and they were monitoring the situation closely. he said the cases emerged overnight, adding: “the situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all uk cities with a large number of chinese students. it’s not too surprising. my suspicion is that there will probably be many more cases in many other cities in the uk.” haas said there was only one laboratory testing for the virus, operated by public health england, and that the cases had been flagged up through the phe infection guidelines as the patients had travelled to wuhan within the last 14 days and were showing signs of respiratory symptoms. universities with links to china have issued warnings to staff and students travelling to and from areas affected by the coronavirus. nine uk institutions have partnerships with wuhan university in hubei province in central china, where the outbreak began. earlier in the day, the uk health secretary, matt hancock, told mps there was an increased likelihood that the coronavirus would arrive in the uk, but said the authorities were well prepared and would remain vigilant. it is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. the world health organization (who) has declared it a pandemic. according to the who, the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. about 80% of people who get covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment. about one in six people, the who says, become seriously ill. the elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from covid-19. in the uk, the national health service (nhs) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: as this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. the antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. in many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. check with your local authorities. in the uk, nhs advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. if you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. china’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in january. as of 6 april, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the johns hopkins university center for systems science and engineering. there have been over 69,500 deaths globally. just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland china. italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in spain. the us now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. more than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus. hancock told the commons that the uk was one of a few countries to have developed a test for the latest coronavirus, so any suspected case could be diagnosed quickly. however, the symptoms do not develop for five to seven days, and sometimes even up to 14, meaning the virus can circulate undetected. the uk has advised against all but essential travel to wuhan, where all the deaths so far have occurred and which is now under lockdown by the chinese authorities. while the uk has put in place measures to check passengers at heathrow airport arriving from wuhan, the chinese government has stopped flights out of the city. “the chief medical officer has revised the risk to the uk population from very low to low and concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well-prepared and well-equipped to deal with them,” hancock told mps. some people arriving on the last flight from wuhan on wednesday said they had not received any health checks at heathrow, mps pointed out. handing out information was the key thing, hancock replied. “the most important part of the monitoring is to ensure everybody knows what to do if the symptoms arise.” several mps said there were substantial numbers of chinese students at universities in their constituencies. there was no specific advice for students, other than the general advice, hancock said. “i’m very happy to take away the point that we will ensure we are communicating through universities uk with all universities, to make sure the message gets to all students directly and they hear the advice that is there for everybody.” the labour mp hilary benn asked what advice would be given to the public about the use of face masks, which they would see being used in china and elsewhere on the television. “people look at what people are doing in countries where the disease has taken hold and ask the authorities, ‘why aren’t we doing the same?’” said benn. hancock replied: “the wearing of face masks is not deemed clinically necessary now, but we will keep that under review and will be guided by the science.”',\n",
              " 'chinese authorities have imposed lockdown measures on ten cities in an unprecedented effort to contain the outbreak of the deadly new virus that has made hundreds of people ill and spread to other parts of the world during the busy lunar new year travel period. authorities banned transport links from wuhan, the capital of hubei province, on thursday morning, suspending buses, subways, ferries, and shutting the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers. later in the day, the nearby central chinese cities of huanggang and ezhou announced similar measures. travel restrictions were also placed on the smaller cities of chibi and zhijiang. starting at midnight, long-distance buses, the rapid transit system, and the train station in huanggang would be shut, according to a notice from the local government. cinemas, internet cafes and other entertainment venues would all stop operating. residents should not leave the city, except for “special reasons”. a government notice in ezhou said the city’s railway would stop operating on thursday evening. in nearby chibi, authorities said buses and rural transport links would be halted. officials also ordered tour operators to cancel operations and said no more large-scale cultural events were to be held. on friday, huangshi in hubei province also halted public transport. the people’s daily newspaper said xiantao, enshi, qianjiang and xianning were also subject to travel restrictions. there have been 830 confirmed cases in china of the coronavirus, from the same family of viruses that gave rise to sars. chinese authorities say 95 patients remain in a critical condition. on thursday, hebei’s provincial health authority said an infected patient had died, marking the first confirmed death outside hubei province, where the outbreak began. on friday morning the official death toll rose to 25. cases have also been confirmed in the us, the uk, taiwan, south korea, thailand, japan, hong kong, vietnam and singapore. officials worry the weeklong lunar new year holiday, which begins on saturday and usually sees hundreds of millions of chinese crisscross the country, will exacerbate an outbreak that has reached almost all of china’s provinces. the state-run beijing news said the capital had cancelled events including two well-known lunar new year temple fairs. the forbidden city, the palace complex in beijing that is now a museum, announced it will close indefinitely on saturday. the country’s railway operator, china state railway group, said passengers would be able to receive full refunds on tickets nationwide starting on friday. while sweeping measures are typical of china’s communist government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people’s liberties, and the effectiveness of such measures is unclear. “to my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,” gauden galea, the world health organization’s representative in china, told the associated press. “it has not been tried before as a public health measure. we cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.” late on thursday wuhan city authorities said that limits on car travel would be introduced for the first time at noon on friday. in wuhan, supermarket shelves were empty and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and isolated themselves at home. petrol stations were overwhelmed as drivers stocked up on fuel, exacerbated by rumours that reserves had run out. local residents said pharmacies had sold out of face masks. “when i saw the news when i woke up, i felt like i was going to go crazy. this is a little too late now. the government’s measures are not enough,” said xiao, 26, a primary schoolteacher in wuhan, who asked not to give her full name. anxiety in wuhan has been exacerbated by reports that hospitals are turning patients away because they do not have enough room. a hospital contacted by the guardian on thursday said it had between 500 and 600 patients and recommended patients go to a community health centre instead. eight hospitals in wuhan put out calls for donations of protective equipment, according to chinese media. officials said they would build a new hospital in six days to accommodate patients, modelled after an isolation facility constructed in beijing during the sars outbreak. it is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. like other coronaviruses, it has

would delay the beginning of the spring term. the illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus appeared last month in wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central china. the vast majority of cases in the mainland have been in the city. analysts have predicted the reported cases will continue to multiply. “even if  are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,” galea said. the number of cases was not an indicator of the outbreak’s severity, so long as the mortality rate remained low, he added. the coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the sars outbreak that spread from china to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and middle eastern respiratory syndrome which developed from camels. china is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of sars. for months, even after the illness had spread around the world, china parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid who experts. in the current outbreak, china has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and president xi jinping has emphasised that as a priority. on thursday a who committee said the outbreak does not yet constitute a public health emergency of international concern. previous emergencies have included ebola and zika. associated

and what is this new technology that america\\'s biggest companies are in a race to implement? according to cavanagh, consumer trends and rising prices are driving consumers away. considering the vast amount of competition for streaming media, it is likely comcast is losing subscribers to other services. the top competitor is netflix(nflx) but even it is under pressure from competition. disney is emerging as a winner in the online/streaming space with the launch of disney + last year and there’s always hulu and hbo max to consider. comcast is fighting back comcast ceo brian roberts isn’t content to sit back and let his competition take his business. comcast, through nbc/universal, announced just last week its entry into the streaming wars. peacock, a three-tiered streaming service, is scheduled to launch july 2020 and compete with the big boys. notably, the company is planning to take back its content leased to other outlets so it has leverage within the market. in a televised interview, roberts said “we hope in the next four or five years to get to the kind of  ... that some other platforms are getting today, … so i think we’ve given ourselves a long runway to scale up, take back some of the content that’s on other platforms, make some original content, engage with customers.” cash, cash flow, dividends and comcast technical outlook comcast is a cash-flow machine no matter what the 4th revenue and eps comparisons say. the company reported net-cash from operations of $6.2 billion with $2.5 billion in free-cash-flow. considering the company’s history of dividend increases, 12 years now, it is no surprise management increased the distribution today. comcast management increased the dividend to $0.92. that’s a 10% increase and brings the forward-looking payout ratio to 28.0%. with such a low payout ratio the company has plenty of cash to invest in the digital platform and pay the dividend. also, future increases can be expected regardless of the amount of revenue or earnings growth. the only downside to comcast distribution is the yield. at 2.0% it’s only a hair above the broad market average and far less than what you can get with other sectors. technically speaking, there is good news and bad news. the good news is that buyers are present above the short-term moving average. this shows confidence in the company’s growth outlook, about 5% revenue and 6% eps in 2020, and its ability to compete with streaming. the bad news is that price action has fallen below a crucial resistance target at the previous all-time high. if price action cannot regain the upper side of the $47.25 level i would expect lower prices to come. in the near-term, comcast is likely to drift lower and test support at the short-term moving average. support may kick in around $45.50, if that level doesn’t hold a move down to the $43.00 level is possible. 6 stocks to help you profit off the coronavirus ppe boom every major global event brings with it changes to our national lexicon. before the covid-19 pandemic, few americans knew what the initials ppe stood for. today, virtually anyone knows that ppe stands for personal protective equipment.at the onset of the mitigation policies, the goal of flattening the curve was being done to prevent our health care system from becoming overwhelmed. part of that concern stemmed from a shortage of personal protective equipment. these are the masks, gloves, goggles and gowns that help protect medical workers against viral or bacterial infections.as the novel coronavirus became labeled a global pandemic, the global mantra became to “flatten the curve” in an effort to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.the united states is being referred to as being on a war time footing. manufacturers that were already producing ppe have significantly ramped up capacity. and many companies are converting their excess manufacturing capacity to produce personal protective equipment.in fairness, this may only be a reason for some of these companies to “keep the lights on” right now. but many of these companies have a good story to tell. and it’s that story that can make them solid investments in the future. view the \"6 stocks to help you profit off the coronavirus ppe boom\". complete the form below to receive the latest headlines and analysts\\' recommendations for your stocks with our free daily email newsletter:',\n",
              " 'ford (nyse:f) stock is down about 1.5% so far in 2020. but in the last 12 months, the stock has been up nearly 8%. while that is pedestrian to the broader market, there may be a story forming about ford. and while it’s not as spectacular as the mania currently surrounding tesla (nasdaq:tsla), it may provide value investors with an interesting way to play the burgeoning electric vehicle (ev) market. but i’ll start with a disclaimer. contrary to the headline of this article, i know that tesla is playing in a much different sandbox than ford. tesla is being priced and evaluated more as a tech company, than an auto maker. but tesla is changing the conversation about electric vehicles. and that’s an area where it does have something in common with the motor city icon. ford’s investment in electrification is paying off when ford announced it was making a major push into electric vehicles, many industry analysts scoffed. the company looked to be gambling both its short-term and long-term future on a technology that looked to be years away. but today, electric vehicles represent where the growth is coming from in the industry. and where some automakers are trying to play catch up, ford finds itself ahead of the curve. specifically, ford is preparing to launch its headline ev, the mustang mach-e late in 2020. at this point, demand for the mach-e looks healthy. and that’s only one of over a dozen electric vehicles that ford plans on launching between now and 2022. also, keep in mind that it appears the auto industry is finding its bottom. so if, as expected, the industry starts to rebound over the next two years; and if, as expected, electric vehicles help to lead this growth, then ford will be well-positioned both in terms of revenue and profit. document.write(\\'\\');jeff brown, a former silicon valley ceo, holds live event off-campus of yale university for a select audience to reveal new \"5g device\" but the company is about more than just electric vehicles what has helped ford remain profitable has been the popularity of its ford f-series trucks. to that end, the company introduced new models of its ram 1500 and chevrolet silverado 1500 that show the company is not taking its status for granted. “the fitness of the kind of competition that comes at us gets better and better,” admits ceo jim hackett. “we can’t stand on our laurels here, and we’re not … we now start to marry the intelligence – the emergence of the connectivity, the awareness of how people use our f-150s has probably never been higher. we have to keep changing the product for them in ways that they care about.” growth versus value the difference between tesla and ford is about more than what sector they play in. in fact, tesla has just reached a higher market cap than ford has had … ever. the real issue is what kind of investor is attracted to each stock. and while tesla may or may not be a smart growth stock, it is certainly not a value stock. when investors look at tesla stock, it’s easy to see that what the stock may be is a lot different than what it is. i can’t say when, or if, tesla shares will come down to earth. what i can say is at over $500 per share, i’m looking for a dip before deciding to take a plunge. ford on the other hand, looks inexpensive right now. and i’m not just talking about its share price (which is currently around $9). the stock looks to absorb most of the downturn in the automotive market and therefore may be very attractive for investors who are looking to swoop up a bargain. from a fundamental standpoint, the stock looks reasonably priced. the company’s current forward price/earnings ratio of just over 7 times earnings is consistent with its five-year average. and that would put the stock in the range of $11 per share. and don’t forget about the dividend. ford currently pays out a 60 cent per share dividend every year (15 cents per quarter). the company hasn’t increased its dividend in five years, and critics point out that the company may have to cut the dividend to meet some of its long-term growth objectives. but with a payout ratio of around 46%, the dividend looks to be very safe in the short term. and that’s all i’m really talking about right now. what’s next for ford stock? ford is scheduled to release earnings on february 4. the company recently issued an sec filing that says the company will take a $2.2 billion pretax hit due to pension plan contributions and retirement benefits. while this is supposed to reduce the company’s net income by $1.7 billion, it will not impact earnings because it is a special item. the consensus estimate is for the earnings per share of 16 cents.  7 energy stocks to buy on this historical dip it may seem hard to believe, but the current chaos in the energy sector, and oil stocks, in particular, will pass. the novel coronavirus that has birthed a global pandemic is being compared to the spanish flu of 1918.of course, when you have once in a century event, it’s difficult to look back in history and make an apples-to-apples comparison to our current situation. this isn’t to minimize our current situation. it’s simply to say that the market is forward-looking, but it’s also emotional. and it also hates uncertainty.in a typical economic downturn, demand decreases, and investors are advised to “buy the dip.” but in the current environment, demand has been destroyed. millions of americans are being asked, and in some cases ordered, to stay home. and this simply means that oil demand is down. and investors are looking at prices that are, in some cases, at all-time lows.the trading app robinhood is frequented by millennial investors. and according to the latest information, many investors are trying to buy the dip on old guard oil stocks. that may be a mistake.but the energy sector is about more than just oil stocks. there are several companies that are holding their own in the current environment. and that means when the economy opens up, these companies will be well-positioned for further growth.currently, the volatility and uncertainty surrounding energy stocks make them a poor choice for growth investors. however, many of these companies in this presentation offer a secure dividend that, along with the potential for capital appreciation, can make them a solid play for income investors. view the \"7 energy stocks to buy on this historical dip\". complete the form below to receive the latest headlines and analysts\\' recommendations for your stocks with our free daily email newsletter:',\n",
              " 'hong kong — the outbreak of a deadly disease in china has cast a pall over growth prospects for the world’s second largest economy, raising fears about the global outlook if the mysterious coronavirus spreads or worsens. financial markets across asia fell on thursday, led by sharp drop in stocks in china, as investors pondered the potential impact of the coronavirus. the extent of its severity has become more clear over the past two days, as chinese officials reported a surge in cases and a jump in the number of deaths to at least 26. on thursday, officials extended limits on movement in and out of wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, to two nearby cities that millions more call home the uncertainty has put a palpable damper on chinese life just before the lunar new year holiday — typically a time of travel, shopping and gift-giving —which begins on friday. train stations and airports were subdued as travelers changed plans for the weeklong holiday, and seven of the most anticipated film openings of the holiday season were postponed. the forbidden city in beijing — china’s most popular tourist attraction — announced, without giving further information, that it would be closed starting on saturday. on the minds of many in china and around the world right now: could this new virus cause the same kind of damage as the sars epidemic, which killed 800 people in 2003? the question is a crucial one beyond china, because the chinese economy has for years been one of the world’s most powerful growth engines. a stumble in china could hobble jobs and growth elsewhere. china’s growth in 2003 plunged briefly during the height of sars but came roaring back in a time when global companies were building chinese factories and exporting more and more goods abroad. today, china’s economy is bigger but is growing at its slowest pace in nearly three decades. it is grappling with problems like the trade war with the united states and a campaign to wean local governments and companies off their addiction to borrowing. it also depends more on consumers like mo chen, 29, who is curtailing her holiday travel plans, to stay on the safe side. in 2003, the worst-hit sectors were transportation, retail and restaurants. ms. mo, who works for an internet company in shanghai, had been looking forward to traveling home to see her family in xiangyang, hubei province, nearly 200 miles from wuhan. but given the outbreak, she and her brother, who lives in the city of hangzhou, decided not to go home. it will be the first time that ms. mo has not spent lunar new year with her parents. she now plans to stock up on supplies and stay home, not even venturing out to meet friends or go to the movies. she also intends to skip a trip to the mall to buy new outfits, because nobody will be around to see her wear them. her brother, meanwhile, is planning to buy pots and pans. “he never cooks,” she said. “he always either eats out or eats at the company canteen. but last night our mom asked us to stock up on food, not go out and cook at home.” for now, the impact is not yet clear. the authorities seem to be responding faster to this outbreak than they did in 2003, but china’s censors are erasing anything that veers from the official narrative. the new coronavirus appears to be less deadly than sars, but it is difficult to detect, and the authorities started limiting movement out of wuhan only after many people had set out for their holiday travels. “it’s going to depend on how china continues to be transparent with the international community,” said peter levesque, the managing director of modern terminals, a port operator in hong kong. “that’s all business can ask for. the rest is unknown.” wuhan is essential to commerce in its region of china, though the economic impact there is expected to be muted by the advent of the holiday. the city is a major national transport hub and has become a center for auto manufacturing, with factories that build cars for general motors, honda and many others, as well as dozens of auto parts makers. but the effect on people across the country could be a more important factor. over the long term, china wants its consumers to spend more. beijing has sought to develop a consumer culture similar to that of the united states so that china’s economy becomes less reliant on big construction and infrastructure projects that often receive government financing. but that shift makes china more vulnerable to events that spook shoppers. chinese consumer sentiment had already been bruised. families spent the past year watching prices rise in grocery stores, increases due largely to the outbreak of a pig disease that depleted much of china’s pork supply. more families are saving rather than spending, and are worrying about the future. “we will probably see a lot less domestic activity than we would normally see at this time of the year,” said julian evans-pritchard, a senior china economist at capital economics. updated june 12, 2020 so far, the evidence seems to show it does. a widely cited paper published in april suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. recently, a top expert at the world health organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,”  but she later walked back that statement. touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. but it can happen. a number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. but a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. the best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. a study by european scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. having type a blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. the unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in may, the labor department said on june 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in april, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after world war ii. but the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in april. mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across america are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. while many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. american adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in march than they were in january. but there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. first, “start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before covid,” says dr. monica rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the shirley ryan abilitylab in chicago. thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “when you haven’t been exercising, you lose muscle mass.” expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. but sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home. states are reopening bit by bit. this means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. the federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. even if you aren’t being told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. the c.d.c. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. if air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. most important: wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. if possible, choose a window seat. a study from emory university found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. disinfect hard surfaces. when you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees fahrenheit or higher. if you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of covid-19 complications. the c.d.c. has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. until now, the c.d.c., like the w.h.o., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. if you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. they should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. if you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the c.d.c. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. they will decide if you need to be tested. keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. “the concern is that it encourages people to cancel their travel plans, and it comes at a crucial time in terms of holiday travel and spending,” he said. the disease has struck during one of the year’s busiest spending seasons. box office sales during the lunar new year holiday last year set a record, reaching $860 million over the first six days of the holiday, according to maoyan, a ticketing service owned by alibaba. new spending records will be harder to attain this year. among the film debuts postponed on thursday was “boonie bears: the wild life,” a cartoon about clever bears that clash with a hapless logger. in a message to fans on its social media account, the production company wrote, “we don’t want to see audience friends take any health risks,” adding that it did not want to “see that the epidemic may spread further.” other businesses in some parts of china have been temporarily closed. major airlines, including hong kong’s flagship carrier, cathay pacific, have restricted flights to wuhan. companies urged employees to wear masks and not to travel. companies that were still offering services urged caution. didi chuxing, china’s equivalent to uber, sent a message to passengers saying that “due to the virus, for the health and safety of everyone, both drivers and passengers should wear face masks.” hong kong, the semiautonomous chinese city that has been roiled by anti-beijing protests, could sustain yet another blow. the region is already in an economic recession after over half a year of antigovernment protests. “if you look at those sectors of the economy, the retail and local businesses, they have already been sadly bruised by the protests last year,” said tara joseph, the president of the american chamber of commerce in hong kong. “this would just be an extra kick in the teeth that they don’t need.” but, she added, “it’s too early to panic.” cao li contributed research.',\n",
              " 'this briefing has ended. read about developments in the coronavirus outbreak here. the chinese national health commission reported early friday that there have been 25 deaths from and 830 cases of the coronavirus, a sharp increase. the death toll increased by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours, while the number of confirmed cases jumped by more than 200. earlier, the first death was confirmed outside the virus epicenter. a patient died in the province of hebei — more than 600 miles north of the city where the outbreak began — after contracting the coronavirus, the provincial authorities announced on thursday. the victim was an 80-year-old man who had lived in the city of wuhan, where the outbreak originated, for more than two months, according to hebei’s provincial health department. wuhan is a major port city of 11 million in the province of hubei, where all of the 17 previously reported deaths have taken place. the victim died on wednesday, but officials did not confirm that he had died of the coronavirus until thursday, the hebei provincial announcement said. the announcement did not say when the man had returned to hebei province from wuhan, but said that he had developed chest tightness and difficulty breathing after his return. like many of the other confirmed victims of the virus, he appeared to have other underlying health issues: after being admitted to a hospital, he also was treated for high blood pressure, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the authorities said. after two days of deliberations, an emergency committee convened by the world health organization decided not to declare a global health emergency — but planned to meet again within 10 days, acknowledging the “urgency” of the situation. the committee had first planned to issue a recommendation on wednesday about whether to declare an emergency (the decision ultimately falls to the w.h.o.’s director general). such a declaration would give the w.h.o. broader authority to shape different countries’ responses. but committee members were split. on thursday, after news of wuhan’s travel restrictions and the increased death count emerged, the committee met again, and decided not to recommend the declaration. several members thought it was “still too early,” the w.h.o. said in a news release. agency officials explained that although the disease has reached beyond china, the number of cases in other countries is still relatively small, and the disease does not seem to be spreading within those countries. “at this time, there is no evidence of human to human transmission outside china,” dr. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, the w.h.o.’s director general, said at a news conference in geneva. “that doesn’t mean it won’t happen.” “make no mistake,” he said. “this is an emergency in china, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. it may yet become one.” only five global public health emergency declarations have been made in the past. the decisions are fraught, with health authorities wary of causing panic, or of suggesting that governments cannot handle outbreaks on their own. still, the w.h.o. called on the chinese government to share more information on how it was handling the crisis.  the authorities expanded travel restrictions to several chinese cities near wuhan hours after announcing that the death toll and number of cases had risen sharply. currently, at least 18 victims have been confirmed dead and more than 600 infected, according to chinese officials. the restrictions on train and other forms of travel will apply to tens of millions of people and come just days before the lunar new year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel around and out of the country. the chinese authorities on thursday morning closed off wuhan by canceling flights and trains leaving the city, and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it. late on thursday, the local authorities also announced that they would suspend for-hire vehicles and limit taxis, beginning at noon on friday. roughly 30,000 people fly out of wuhan on an average day, according to air traffic data. many more leave using ground transportation like trains and cars. by evening, officials planned to also close off huanggang, a city of seven million about 30 miles east of wuhan, shut rail stations in the nearby city of ezhou, which has about one million residents, and impose travel restrictions on the smaller cities of chibi and zhijiang. in huanggang, public transportation and departing trains stopped at midnight. residents are not allowed to leave the city without special permission, according to a government statement. in ezhou, all rail stations were to be closed. separately, the provincial authorities in hubei announced late thursday some restrictions for the entire province, not just specific cities. travel agencies are prohibited from taking customers and organizing tours, for example, and business trips are being suspended. schools throughout the province, which have breaks scheduled for the lunar new year holiday, will postpone their post-break start dates indefinitely. the new virus, which first emerged at the end of december, has sickened people in taiwan, vietnam, japan, thailand, singapore, south korea and the united states. it has raised the specter of a repeat of the sars epidemic, which broke out in china in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis. that virus eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide. in beijing, the government said it would cancel large public gatherings for the holiday, including fairs at temples that usually draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, and the forbidden city, a popular tourist attraction in the heart of the capital, will close starting on saturday. coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble the sun’s corona. they can infect both animals and people, and cause illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe conditions like sars. symptoms of infection include a high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions. milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult. the incubation period — the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms — is believed to be about two weeks. while the headlines are alarming, health experts cautioned that it was too early to gauge the severity of the outbreak. there are too many unknowns: where did it start? how easily does it spread? how does it compare to other coronaviruses, like sars? dr. william schaffner, a specialist in infectious diseases at vanderbilt university medical center, said the illness should be viewed in perspective. while a new virus spreading internationally gets more attention, the much more common influenza virus is the bigger hazard for most people, he said. “if i look at this winter respiratory season, influenza is going to cause many more illnesses and more deaths than this coronavirus,” he said. “it’s one of those circumstances where, if familiarity doesn’t breed contempt, it certainly breeds a certain nonchalance.” the virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in china and a number of other countries. as anxiety about the virus has grown, governments around the world have taken precautions to isolate anyone displaying symptoms, though several cases have proved not to be the coronavirus. health officials in the united states said on thursday that there could be a second infection in the country, after the authorities in washington state confirmed earlier this week that a man there had fallen sick with the wuhan coronavirus. the second possible patient was in brazos county, texas, where officials said they were keeping a patient isolated at home while they did additional testing. vietnam’s ministry of health announced on thursday that it had confirmed two cases of the coronavirus, in two male chinese patients. in mexico, two out of five potential coronavirus cases were officially ruled out by the health ministry on thursday after comprehensive tests were conducted, according to state and federal government officials. a health official said that one of the patients, a 57-year-old professor, had been diagnosed with a common cold. the three other cases, in the western state of jalisco, were under observation and were being tested, according to the health ministry report. the patients include a 42-year old man who returned to mexico from wuhan on jan. 10, and two other women who had contact with him. across wuhan on thursday, residents — some wearing masks, some sniffing or coughing — visited hospitals and clinics seeking treatment. in interviews with a new york times correspondent in the city, some said they were angry about the sudden lockdown. others said they were confused by the restrictions. outside the wuhan no. 3 hospital, yang lin, said she had come to the hospital to see if a sniffling cold she had might be the coronavirus. after a quick check, the doctors told her not to worry. but she was not reassured. “they said it was just a common cold, and told me to get some medicine and go home,” ms. yang, 28, said. “but how am i to know? they didn’t even take my temperature. it’s just not responsible.” the outbreak is testing wuhan’s health care system. several wuhan residents said on social media websites that they had gone from hospital to hospital, waiting in lines for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment later if symptoms persisted in a few days. doctors told some patients that there was a shortage of hospital beds as well as testing kits, according to posts on chinese social media sites. china’s ministry of finance said on thursday that it would allocate 1 billion yuan, or about $144 million, to officials in hubei to fight the virus, though it did not specify how the money would be used. wuhan officials also said that they would construct a new hospital specifically for coronavirus patients. the new hospital was ordered built within six days, according to people’s daily, the ruling communist party’s main newspaper. cheng shidong, a doctor at the zhongnan hospital of wuhan university, said in an interview that his hospital had set up 100 beds to receive infected patients, but that it didn’t have enough protective material, such as masks and suits, for the medical staff. in wuhan, ms. yang said that while she was in a pharmacy buying medicine, another person complained that he thought he had the coronavirus but had not been isolated. the city’s medical system, especially its smaller hospitals, seems unprepared for the influx of patients, she said. “i’m willing to accept that we have to stay in wuhan, o.k., but the medical care needs to keep up,” she said. “you shouldn’t tell us we can’t leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. that’s unfair.” china’s health commission, which has tightly controlled news about the toll of the outbreak, released on thursday its most detailed list of the people who have died of the disease. the first 17 people were largely older men, many with underlying health problems. all died in hubei province, which includes the city of wuhan. the first confirmed death was a 61-year-old man who went to a hospital in wuhan on december 27, weak with a fever and a cough. he was transferred to another hospital as his condition worsened, and he was later attached to a machine that helped oxygenate his blood. but he died on jan. 9. twelve of the other 17 deaths in hubei were also men, and four were women, officials said. the youngest victim was a 48-year-old woman who died on monday. the oldest were two 89-year-old men. separately on thursday, the health authorities in hebei province, to the north of hubei province, announced that an 80-year-old man there had died, bringing the death count to 18. many of the victims had underlying conditions like cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, diabetes and parkinson’s disease. most had gone to the hospital with a fever and a cough, though at least three had no fever when they were admitted, according to the health commission. while a full picture of the virus is still unknown, medical experts found positive signs in the fact that the disease did not appear to be killing young and otherwise healthy people. “the majority of fatal cases are elderly and/or have a chronic disease that would increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases,” said dr. w. ian lipkin, an epidemiologist at the mailman school of public health at columbia university in new york. in an unusually blunt interview, dr. guan yi, a professor of infectious diseases in hong kong and expert on sars, criticized the authorities in wuhan for acting too slowly and obstructing his efforts to investigate the outbreak. updated june 12, 2020 touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. but it can happen. a number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. but a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. the best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. so far, the evidence seems to show it does. a widely cited paper published in april suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. recently, a top expert at the world health organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,”  but she later walked back that statement. a study by european scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. having type a blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. the unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in may, the labor department said on june 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in april, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after world war ii. but the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in april. mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across america are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. while many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. american adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in march than they were in january. but there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. first, “start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before covid,” says dr. monica rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the shirley ryan abilitylab in chicago. thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “when you haven’t been exercising, you lose muscle mass.” expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. but sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home. states are reopening bit by bit. this means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. the federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. even if you aren’t being told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. the c.d.c. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. if air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. most important: wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. if possible, choose a window seat. a study from emory university found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. disinfect hard surfaces. when you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees fahrenheit or higher. if you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of covid-19 complications. the c.d.c. has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. until now, the c.d.c., like the w.h.o., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. if you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. they should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. if you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the c.d.c. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. they will decide if you need to be tested. keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. dr. guan, who helped successfully identify the coronavirus that caused sars during the 2002-2003 outbreak in china, told the influential chinese magazine caixin that he was deeply frustrated by the city government’s response to the spread of the virus. he and his team had visited wuhan on tuesday hoping that they could track the animal that was the source of the coronavirus but were shocked to find that residents at a market were not taking any precautions or wearing masks. no special measures were in place at the airport to disinfect surfaces and floors, either. this showed that the city government was being complacent despite the urgent orders handed down by beijing, he said. “i thought at the time, we had to be in a ‘state of war’, but how come the alarm has not been raised?” he told caixin. “poor citizens, they were still preparing to ring in the new year in peace and had no sense about the epidemic.” he also criticized the local authorities for disinfecting the market where many infections had been traced to, saying that made it difficult for researchers to investigate where the virus came from. “i consider myself a veteran in battles,” he said, citing his experience with bird flu, sars, and other outbreaks. “but with this wuhan pneumonia, i feel extremely powerless.”  there are growing concerns that the chinese authorities are underreporting the number of people who are ill with the virus. relatives of patients say that some hospitals, strapped for resources as they deal with an influx of patients, are turning sick people away or refusing to test them for the coronavirus. many people remain skeptical of the government’s official statistics, with memories of the effort to cover up the severity of the sars outbreak still fresh. in wuhan, kyle hui, an architect from shanghai, said that doctors at tongji hospital declined to test his stepmother for the virus, even though she was showing symptoms like a cough and a fever. she died on jan. 15 of “severe pneumonia,” according to a copy of her death certificate. mr. hui said that hospital workers treated his stepmother as if she had the coronavirus, wearing hazmat suits. after she died, the hospital instructed the family to cremate the body immediately. mr. hui said that after her death, doctors informed the family that they suspected his stepmother had the coronavirus. “i’m very sad my stepmother left without any dignity,” mr. hui said during an interview this week in a cafe in wuhan. “there was no time to say goodbye.” chris buckley, our chief china correspondent, headed to wuhan from beijing to cover the outbreak. he is sending live dispatches from his trip. 11 a.m. — aboard the g79 high speed train the g79 high speed train from beijing to hong kong, which stops in wuhan, was crowded with holiday passengers. the train was a hubbub of conversation, much of it about the deadly coronavirus and the lockdown around wuhan. guo jing, a worker from northeast china, was headed with two friends for a holiday in macau. after some hesitation, they had taken off their masks. “they’re too uncomfortable inside,” mr. guo said. “my view is we have to be careful but not panic. if you’re the panicky type, then you wouldn’t be on this train.” 1:37 p.m. — aboard the g79 high speed train half an hour out from wuhan, the train is quite crowded with passengers. when i explain that i’m getting off at wuhan, the reactions vary from advice — wear masks, don’t go, drink lots of water — to mordant jokes that i may be there a long time. “you should know that they probably won’t let people out until the new year holiday is over,” said one woman, who would only give her family name, yang. 2:29 p.m. — wuhan wuhan railway station, usually thronging with people in the days before the lunar new year holiday, is very empty. an announcement playing on a loop over the speakers tells the few people here that residents cannot leave the city and the station is temporarily closed. scientists have been scrambling to understand the source of the coronavirus, in particular, the animals from which the virus may have jumped to humans. many of the cases in wuhan were connected to a market that sold live poultry and exotic animal meats. the market was closed and disinfected. early epidemiological research is indicating that it may have come from wild animals such as bamboo rats and badgers, said dr. zhong nanshan, a prominent chinese scientist who was the country’s leading expert during the sars outbreak, during an interview with state media on monday. named for its bamboo-heavy diet, the cat-sized bamboo rat has become a somewhat popular delicacy in recent years in china, promoted for its purported health properties. a group of chinese researchers from the eastern city of tianjin and nanjing in the south, said the wuhan coronavirus may have originated from chinese horseshoe bats, according to a study they published in the chinese journal of bioinformatics on tuesday. china’s national genomics data center said the wuhan virus was 88 percent genetically similar to a sars-like coronavirus that was collected from bats in china in 2017. still another group of chinese scientists suggested that snakes were the “most probable wildlife animal reservoir” for the novel coronavirus, then transmitted to humans, in an article published in the journal of medical virology wednesday. but that assessment immediately drew fire from the international health community. the study’s lead author, wei ji of the peking university health science center school of basic medical sciences, did not actually find the new coronavirus in a snake, noted david robertson, a professor at the university of glasgow. instead, dr. ji and his colleagues compared the genomes of an assortment of viruses and hosts and claimed to find a similarity between the genomes of the new virus and snakes. dr. ji did not respond to an email query by the time of publication. the announcement that the city of wuhan would be temporarily sealed off from the outside world starting at 10 a.m. on thursday came while most residents were asleep at 2 a.m. some decided to flee the city. residents were seen hauling their luggage to a train station in the early hours before the citywide lockdown took effect, the chinese news outlet caixin reported. several people said they would buy tickets for any destination as long as they could leave wuhan, the magazine reported. lines of passengers in masks and down jackets, lugging suitcases, formed outside the major hankou railway station just 20 minutes before the cutoff time, a live video by media outlet the paper showed. han zhen and wang mengkai, two migrant workers from henan province, said they had rushed to the railway station in order to leave on wednesday night, but missed the last train out. both said they were frustrated by the sudden lockdown and were scrambling to find a way home. “it’s serious but not that serious,” said mr. wang, who works in an electronics parts factory. “we’re trying to figure out how we can get home. if we can’t get out on a train, we’ll try putting together a car with a driver.” asked if they were motivated to leave by fear of the virus, mr. han said: “no, we are not scared.” “it’s the new year, we just have to go home,” he said.  reporting was contributed by amy qin, vivian wang, russell goldman, chris buckley, javier hernández, austin

              " 'a team of researchers pointed to the many-banded krait snake as one possible source of the coronavirus that originated in asia. credit: alamy as human cases rise in a mysterious viral outbreak that originated in china , scientists are rushing to identify the animals, where they suspect the epidemic began. in a controversial study published last night, a team of researchers in china claimed to have an answer: snakes. but other scientists say there is no proof that viruses such as those behind the outbreak can infect species other than mammals and birds. “nothing supports snakes being involved,” says david robertson, a virologist at the university of glasgow, uk. china coronavirus: six questions scientists are asking the pathogen responsible for the outbreak belongs to a large family called coronaviruses, which includes the viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), as well as those behind the common cold. the latest virus — currently known as 2019-ncov — is most closely related to sars and related viruses that circulate in bats. but these can also infect other animals that can pass the virus to humans. many scientists suspect that an unknown animal carrying 2019-ncov spread the virus to humans at a live seafood and wild animal market in wuhan, where the first cases were documented in december. “the intermediate host is the missing piece of the puzzle: how have all these people got infected?” says robertson. hedgehogs, chickens and bats a team led by wei ji, a microbiologist at peking university health science center school of basic medical sciences in beijing, looked for a sign that 2019-ncov had adapted to any specific animal host. most amino acids are encoded by multiple codons — sequences of three dna or rna nucleotide triplets that encode amino acids. one way that viruses adapt is by encoding proteins using the same choice of codons as their host. wei’s team compared the codons favoured by 2019-ncov with those preferred by potential hosts including hedgehogs, pangolins, bats, chickens, humans and snakes. how quickly does the wuhan virus spread? the team reported that 2019-ncov’s choice of codons was most similar to those used by two snakes: bungarus multicinctus (the many-banded krait) and naja atra (the chinese cobra). snakes were sold at the wuhan seafood and animal market, the researchers note. “taken together, snakes could be the most likely wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-ncov,” they write in a paper published on 22 january in the journal of medical virology 1 . robertson says it’s unlikely that 2019-ncov has infected any secondary animal host for long enough to alter its genome significantly. “it takes a long time for such a process to play out,” he says. evidence gap “they have no evidence snakes can be infected by this new coronavirus and serve as a host for it,” says paulo eduardo brandão, a virologist at the university of são paulo who is investigating whether coronaviruses can infect snakes at all. “there’s no consistent evidence of coronaviruses in hosts other than mammals and aves (birds).” stop the wuhan virus wei’s team has not yet responded to e-mails from nature ’s news team seeking comment on the paper and the criticism it has received. many researchers are sceptical that the animal host or hosts of 2019-ncov can be identified without further field and laboratory work. many hope that genetic tests of animals or environmental sources, such as cages and containers, from the wuhan market will turn up clues. a mammal is the most likely candidate, says cui jie, a virologist at the pasteur institute of shanghai who was part of a team that identified sars-related viruses in bats from a cave in yunnan province in southwestern china in 2017 2 . sars and 2019-ncov are part of a virus subgroup known as betacoronaviruses. fieldwork in the wake of the 2002–03 sars outbreak has found such viruses only in mammals, cui says. “clearly this 2019-ncov is a mammalian virus.”',\n",
              " ' authorities have widened a travel lockdown in central china, ring-fencing millions of residents in a race to contain a deadly virus that is spreading throughout asia and across the world. the clampdown -- which comes amid the lunar new year, china\\'s busiest travel period -- reflects mounting fears that the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus could give rise to a pandemic. the virus has killed at least 25 people in china, several of whom did not have pre-existing conditions before they contracted the illness, with more than 830 infected. still, the world health organization\\'s (who) emergency committee said thursday it was too early to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency. earlier in the day, david heymann, the chairman of a who committee gathering data on the virus, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought. it initially appeared to spread only by very close contact that would typically occur within a family -- such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating utensils -- but now evidence is accruing that shows more distant contact could spread the virus, such as if a sick person were to sneeze or cough near someone else\\'s face. read more he said there is no evidence at this point that the virus is airborne and could be spread across a room, as happens with the flu or measles. mounting evidence suggests the virus is spreading outside mainland china, with various countries reporting their first cases. in scotland, five people were tested for suspected coronavirus after traveling from wuhan. hong kong confirmed two cases of the virus and singapore confirmed its first, a 66-year-old chinese national who had also been in wuhan. saudi arabia has denied there are any cases of the virus in its territory, following reports that an indian nurse working in the country had been diagnosed. china\\'s race to contain it wuhan -- ground zero for the pneumonia-like respiratory virus -- \"temporarily\" closed its airport and railway stations on thursday for departing passengers. all public transport services in the city of 11 million people have also been suspended until further notice. on thursday afternoon, transport authorities began shutting down some of the main highways leaving wuhan, according to state news agency xinhua. a visual guide to the wuhan coronavirus the wearing of face masks is now mandatory in all public places in the city, including hotels, restaurants, parks, cafes, and shopping malls. \"people who don\\'t obey the requirements shall be dealt with by authorities in accordance with their respective duties and laws,\" a statement from wuhan\\'s municipal government said on wednesday. authorities in huanggang, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of wuhan, announced a series of similar measures cutting off the city as of midnight local time (11 a.m. et on thursday). government officials said in a statement that the city\\'s subway and train stations will close, per a report in the people\\'s daily, a state-run newspaper. all theaters, internet cafes and indoor public culture, tourism and entertainment facilities in the city will also stop business, people\\'s daily reported. hundreds of thousands of people will likely be affected. the entire administrative area of huanggang has a population of 7.5 million, but people\\'s daily reported that the lockdown only applies to the urban area, which is only a part of the total population. in ezhou, the city\\'s railway station has been closed \"in order to fully conduct prevention and control of the new type of pneumonia ... effectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the safety and health of the people,\" according to a statement from city\\'s coronavirus disease prevention control headquarters on thursday. there was an unusual flurry of activity around the train stations in wuhan early thursday morning, as passengers -- most of them wearing face masks -- scrambled to leave the city before the lockdown began. families were seen unloading their cars and hurrying to get into lines that already stretched outside the doors. travelers at wuhan\\'s hankou railway station queue to leave the city early on thursday morning before the citywide lockdown came into effect. at wuhan\\'s hankou railway station, one of the country\\'s busiest high-speed rail hubs, officials used thermal detectors to scan for potential fevers as dozens of passengers filed through the security screening. inside, crowds were shoulder to shoulder as they waited for trains out of the city. the mass exodus was met with anger from many users of the weibo microblogging platform. \"wuhan people, get out of shanghai,\" one person posted. \"don\\'t sneak in and spread chaos.\" others shared their fears over the virus, and cautionary warnings. \"don\\'t panic and try not to go out,\" one person said. another person posted they had considered fleeing wuhan. \"i was thinking about my parents and children -- if i bring them, where can we escape to?\" the decision to stop trains and planes to and from wuhan comes shortly before lunar new year begins on january 25 amid what is considered the biggest human migration on the planet, with hundreds of millions of people visiting families and traveling in china or throughout asia. inside wuhan, the epicenter wuhan is one of china\\'s most important cities. located on the confluence of the yangtze river and its largest tributary, the han river, it is considered the political and economic capital of central china. for those remaining in the city, there is a sense of unease. jan renders, a 29-year-old phd student in wuhan, told cnn that many shops are closing for the lunar new year holiday, so people had already been stocking up on supplies. he said he was able to buy enough food for at least a week. \"but of course people aren\\'t sure whether shops will be going back to normal soon,\" he said. another man in wuhan sent cnn a photo inside a grocery store thursday morning that showed several empty shelves. the man, who asked not to be identified, said most of the food was sold out. the wuhan new-type coronavirus pneumonia command -- a task-force set up to deal with the crisis -- said in a statement that wuhan has a sufficient supply and reserve of food, medical supplies and commodities. disease detectives hunting down more information about \\'super spreader\\' of wuhan coronavirus \"there is no need for the general public of the city to panic or hoard in order to prevent unnecessary wastes,\" the command said. the scale of the challenge facing authorities tasked with implementing the blockade is immense. by way of comparison, the lockdown is akin to closing down all transport links for a city more than three times the size of chicago, two days before christmas. \"the chinese new year is the most important festival for chinese. and many of the mobile population, they\\'re coming from rural china to work in wuhan, and now you ask them not to leave to see their relatives, that is difficult,\" professor yuen kwok-yung, a leading microbiologist, told cnn. yuen was part of a group of high-level experts who visited wuhan earlier this week and recommended on sunday that the chinese central government should stop people traveling to and from the city. \"it has to be done,\" he said. \"if you allow people to go out of wuhan, especially those who may have symptoms, then the exported case numbers will continue to surge, and that is not a good thing for the whole outbreak control.\" \"the mainland government policy now is that nobody should leave wuhan and nobody should come into wuhan,\" he continued. a growing number of cases chinese health authorities said on friday that at least 830 cases of the wuhan coronavirus had been confirmed. the death toll rose on friday to 25, from 17 the day before -- with all but one of those deaths in hubei, the central chinese province of which wuhan is the capital. the other death was in hebei province, close to beijing. cases of the virus have now been reported in nearly every chinese province, with two cases confirmed in macao, and two in hong kong. the self-governing island of taiwan has also confirmed a case. beyond china, officials in washington state said on tuesday that a man in his 30s is the first confirmed case on us soil . a total of nine cases have also been reported in singapore, south korea, thailand, japan and vietnam. the true extent of the wuhan coronavirus is unclear, however, and official figures may be an underestimation as mild symptoms and delayed onset mean cases are likely to have been undetected, a team of scientists have said. scientists at imperial college london estimate that around 4,000 people are likely to have been infected in wuhan city alone as of january 18. passengers wearing face masks onboard one of the last trains to leave wuhan before a citywide lockdown came into effect. what we know about the virus officially called the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), the contagion is in the same family of infections as severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). sars infected 8,000 people and caused 774 deaths in 2002 and 2003. coronaviruses are transmitted by animals and people, and the wuhan strain has been linked to a market in the city that was selling seafood and live animals, including wild species. the coronavirus that causes sars was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of china that was sold in similar markets. chinese health officials said human-to-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed, raising the chance of its spread. in one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient unknown to be carrying the virus were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily. snakes could be the source of the wuhan coronavirus outbreak the disease is mainly transmitted \"through the respiratory tract,\" li bin, china\\'s national health commissioner said on wednesday, adding that \"there is possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease.\" li said that wuhan and hubei provincial authorities should tighten the regulation of farm markets and wild animals. he also urged the public to avoid crowds and minimize large gatherings. china on tuesday announced it was adopting class a prevention and control measures, typically used for major outbreaks such as plague and cholera. the designation has given health officials sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients. china previously used such measures in 2009 to tackle an outbreak of h1n1, introducing mandatory quarantine for anyone who had \"close contact\" with an infected person, including foreigners arriving in the country from areas where h1n1 outbreaks had been reported. international containment efforts japanese officers work at a health screening station as they observe passengers arriving on a flight from wuhan, china. as officials race to slow the spread of the wuhan coronavirus, containment efforts are being put in place in many travel hubs. airports around the world are increasing health screenings and implementing new quarantine procedures, including in major airports in the us, thailand, singapore and australia. hong kong\\'s mass transit railway (mtr) has halted the sale of high-speed railway tickets to and from wuhan, according to its public relations manager dobie yam. several countries, including the uk and japan, have advised against all but essential travel to wuhan. coronavirus explained: what you need to know however, the world health organization (who) has not yet declared the virus a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" which might merit a coordinated global response. the organization\\'s emergency committee met wednesday in geneva, but decided more information was needed to declare the status of the outbreak and what recommendations should be made regarding it. it is expected to take up the matter again on thursday. meanwhile, a senior state department official said wednesday the united states is concerned about transparency inside the chinese government on the wuhan coronavirus. \"i do believe that the concern you see both inside china and internationally is a reflection of what we\\'ve seen in the past. 2003 was sars, and a number of issues, where the government has been slow to respond out of fear of embarrassment or making things look worse than they are. and that reluctance to respond in a rapid manner doesn\\'t give the global community a

the name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope. a visual guide to the wuhan coronavirus the electron microscopic image, reveals the crown shape structural details for which the coronavirus was named. this image is of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, sars-cov and mers-cov can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans. this new 2019-ncov causes similar symptoms to sars-cov and mers-cov. people infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response. unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. a better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-ncov, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease. read: what exactly is a coronavirus? zoonotic transmission both sars and mers are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. this was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans. first us case of wuhan coronavirus confirmed by cdc now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. field studies have revealed that the original source of sars-cov and mers-cov is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to asia and africa) and camels , respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans. in the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalized were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. however, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market. life inside ground zero of wuhan coronavirus outbreak the hypothesis that the 2019-ncov jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the journal of medical virology. the scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-ncov and all other known coronaviruses. the study of the genetic code of 2019-ncov reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat sars-like coronavirus samples from china, initially suggesting that, like sars and mers, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-ncov. the authors further found that the viral rna coding sequence of 2019-ncov spike protein, which forms the \"crown\" of the virus particle that recognizes the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people. how influenza jumped from animals to humans but when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-ncov, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes. the wuhan huanan wholesale seafood market, where the coronavirus outbreak is believed to have started, is now closed. from bats to snakes the researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favored by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-ncov are most similar to those used in snakes. get cnn health\\'s weekly newsletter sign up here to get the results are in with dr. sanjay gupta every tuesday from the cnn health team. snakes often hunt for bats in wild. reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-ncov might have jumped from the host species -- bats -- to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. however, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery. the authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. searching for the 2019-ncov sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. however, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus\\' source animal. 3 reasons the us is not ready for a pandemic sampling viral rna from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols. the 2019-ncov outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections . haitao guo and shou-jiang gao are professors of microbiology and molecular genetics at the university of pittsburgh. guangxiang \"george\" luo is a professor of microbiology at university of alabama at birmingham. republished under a creative commons license from the conversation .',\n",

where wuhan is located -- with other suspected and confirmed infections cropping up in multiple countries and territories worldwide. coronavirus explained: what you need to know scientists at imperial

of incoming passengers. on thursday, the us centers for disease control and prevention raised its travel notice for wuhan to its highest level, \"warning,\" recommending \"that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to wuhan, china.\" earlier in the week, the agency also activated its emergency operations center -- as it has done with ebola and vaping-related lung injuries -- to centralize the us response to the outbreak. signs and symptoms according to health authorities, patients infected with the wuhan coronavirus may have common symptoms such as fever, cough, headache or muscle pain. a subset of patients may have more severe illness including trouble breathing and scans revealing signs of infection in both lungs. according to the cdc, \"preliminary information suggests that older

among those who never went to the market, are they family members of the people who got infected at the market or colleagues who sit next to each other at work? or maybe they don\\'t know anyone who is sick and it\\'s unclear where they caught it? looking at that chain of infection, are people spreading the disease before they have symptoms, while they have symptoms or after they\\'ve recovered? wuhan: inside the chinese city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak answers to those questions would help officials decide how long to isolate sick patients and who needs to be quarantined to see if they do develop symptoms. \"you\\'ve got to understand how this spreads,\" said patricia stinchfield , vice president of the national foundation for infectious diseases and a cdc adviser. \"and you want to know what people\\'s symptoms are and who\\'s having mild versus severe disease. how many people are hospitalized?

(cnn) senate republicans need to end this impeachment trial before president donald trump confesses to anything else. \"we\\'re doing very well,\" trump said, summing up the performance of his legal team after watching the trial from davos, switzerland. \"but honestly, we have all the material. they don\\'t have the material.\" his timing was problematic, to say the least. democrats had just spent a marathon senate session trying to get republicans to agree to force trump to hand over potentially incriminating \"material,\" including new witnesses and evidence. the president\\'s lawyers say he\\'s got every right to withhold evidence pertinent to the case, because executive privilege covers sensitive presidential decisions. and who knows what \"material\" trump really meant? but his tendency to blow the whistle on himself is one reason why the top senate republican, mitch mcconnell, wants trump acquitted as soon as possible. the president\\'s bursts of honesty have torpedoed his own interests before. after he fired fbi chief james comey, he told nbc that he did it because of the russia investigation, opening himself to accusations of obstructing justice. accused of asking ukraine to probe joe biden, he went onto the white house lawn and asked china to do the same thing. read more last june, trump foreshadowed his impeachment drama when he told abc news that if a foreign government offered him dirt on a political opponent: \"i think i\\'d like to hear it.\" and way back in the 2016 campaign, he chose a televised news conference as his platform to ask russia, \"if you\\'re listening,\" to find hillary clinton\\'s 30,000 missing emails. the same day, russian hackers set out to do that. blurting out inconvenient truths is more than a verbal tic. it\\'s a sign of obliviousness or disdain for codes of presidential restraint — which may be what got trump into impeachment trouble in the first place. the real test since us presidents get impeached on average every 77 years, you might think americans would be buzzing over trump\\'s fate. but what\\'s on everyone\\'s mind is a deadly viral outbreak that has spread from china to several countries, including one case in the us. the wuhan coronavirus has so far killed 17 people and infected more than 500. as the world health organization deliberates whether to call it an emergency of international concern , the world is already reacting. the us national institutes of health and other us scientists are working on a vaccine, and the us centers for disease control and prevention is watching closely. a senior state department official said wednesday that there were encouraging signs that china was getting a handle on the situation , the same day that it shut down public transport in the eastern city of wuhan, where the virus emerged. but memories of beijing\\'s slow response to the 2003 sars epidemic have outsiders concerned. disease doesn\\'t obey borders, which means any truly major health crisis will eventually land on a us president\\'s desk. barack obama, for instance, took over crisis management when an ebola outbreak in west africa threatened to spread to the us in 2014. amid the panic of an epidemic, donald trump would need a steady hand, calming rhetoric, slick coordination among government departments and sensitive diplomacy with foreign capitals — qualities this white house is hardly known for, and at a time when trump is already being driven to distraction.',\n",
              " ' china\\'s economy is slumping and the country is still suffering the effects of the trade war with america. an outbreak of a new and deadly virus is the last thing it needs. the wuhan coronavirus — which has killed 17 people and infected nearly 600 so far — has already roiled chinese markets and thrown plans for the upcoming lunar new year holiday into chaos for millions of people. if beijing fails to contain the disease quickly, it will cause more pain for a country that was already trying to stave off a serious downturn by trying to encourage more consumer spending. an epidemic could have the opposite effect. \"if you\\'re trying to rebalance the chinese economy, this is one of the last events you want to see,\" said logan wright, director of china markets research at rhodium group. the world\\'s second biggest economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades last year as it contended with rising debt, cooling domestic demand and us tariffs, many of which remain in place despite a recent truce . beijing is worried about unemployment, too, and has announced a wave of stimulus measures in recent weeks aimed at preventing mass layoffs. china is really worried about unemployment. here\\'s what it\\'s doing to avoid mass layoffs read more most of the tariffs washington imposed on billions of dollars worth of chinese goods haven\\'t gone away, said ing economist robert carnell, adding that beijing has already nudged \"every policy lever that could be nudged\" to try to offset the effects of the trade dispute. the chinese economy is just \"managing\" right now, he said. wright called the timing of the outbreak \"especially unfortunate\" given the lunar new year holiday. the period is the largest annual human migration on earth , during which hundreds of millions of chinese travelers usually cram themselves into homebound trains, buses and planes for family reunions. the spread of the virus prompted chinese officials to take the largely unprecedented step of partially locking down wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central china where the virus originated. airline regulators have also instructed chinese carriers to offer free cancellations on flights into wuhan, while state media has reported that china\\'s rail authorities are taking similar steps. a sars-like scenario china has a good sense of the economic trouble that could lie ahead. the 2003 sars outbreak , which sickened 8,098 and killed 774 people in 37 different countries, cost the world economy $40 billion, according to a study from the national institutes of health. the economies of china and hong kong bore the brunt of that burden, the authors said. like sars, the wuhan coronavirus outbreak could spark widespread fear and spur people to hunker down and avoid going outside. that kind of behavior would deal a huge blow to the service sector, which now accounts for about 52% of the chinese economy. asian markets drop as coronavirus death toll climbs \"as soon as you\\'re worried, you\\'re worried,\" carnell said. \"you stay home, if you can. you don\\'t go out to the local food court, you try not to travel on public transport, you try to work from home, you don\\'t travel for pleasure. you don\\'t get on a plane, you don\\'t go to the movie theater, restaurants or conferences.\" the sars outbreak forced the cancellation of the week-long may day holiday in china, forced the postponement or abandonment of sporting, business and cultural events and turned beijing into a virtual ghost town . investors are already worried about what the wuhan virus could mean for china\\'s growing travel industry. shares of the country\\'s three major airlines — air china, china southern and china eastern — all closed down 2.5% or more in shanghai and hong kong on thursday. and the aviation sector is \"likely to remain under pressure as confirmed cases are set to increase,\" said andrew lee, equity analyst at jefferies. sars also had a wider impact on the economy. china\\'s annual growth rate slumped to 9.1% in the second quarter of 2003, down from 11.1% in the first quarter of that year, according to brokerage firm macquarie group. this time around, the hit to china\\'s gdp could be even worse, because the sectors most directly affected now make up a bigger part of the economy, commerzbank analyst hao zhou and economist marco wagner wrote in a research note on wednesday. for example, tourism accounts for about 5% of china\\'s gdp today, compared to 2% in 2003. \"if history is a guide, there is clearly a risk that the already struggling china\\'s consumption would face further headwinds if the (wuhan) virus can\\'t be effectively controlled,\" hao and wagner wrote. limiting the economic blow but china is stepping up efforts to contain the virus, including the partial lockdown of wuhan, and some lessons have been learned since 2003, when the authorities were slow to release information and initially downplayed the severity of the sars outbreak. a visual guide to the wuhan coronavirus \"rumors and bad information were drowning out good information at that time, and people were especially careful as a result,\" said wright, adding that he expected the economic impact of the wuhan virus won\\'t be as severe as during the sars crisis. and as scary as the 2003 outbreak was, experts say the impact on china\\'s economy was short-lived. once sars faded away, china\\'s growth rebounded quickly and climbed to 10% in the third quarter of 2003, according to commerzbank\\'s hao and wagner. some remain skeptical about how forthcoming beijing is being about the outbreak. a senior us state department official, for example, said wednesday that the united states is concerned about transparency inside

              " ' those with mild cognitive impairment are thought to have mild memory problems that aren’t severe enough to be diagnosed with dementia. however, in the hope of slowing down memory and thinking decline in those with alzheimer’s disease, researchers tested a certain type of drink called souvenaid. souvenaid is a medical drink containing an active ingredient called fortasyn connect. it’s a combination of fatty acids, vitamins and other nutrients, purposefully developed with the aim to prevent loss of important connections between brain cells that’s evident in alzheimer’s disease. there were 311 people with mild cognitive impairment who were involved in the study. the participants underwent brain scans or spinal tap (also known as lumbar punctures) to evidence that their memory problems were most likely due to the very early stages of alzheimer’s disease. half of the people on the trial took the drink containing fortasyn connect once a day for two years. the other half took a drink with the same calorie content but without the active ingredient. a clinician judged that those who had taken the drink containing fortasyn connect had shown a reduced decline of cognitive and functional performance over the two years. read more: coronavirus latest warning: public health england issues latest statement on deadly virus  brain scans from the trial also showed that the people who took souvenaid had less shrinkage in certain areas of their brain, including in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory. dr doug brown, director of research at alzheimer’s society, said: “this medical drink been shown to slow the decline of thinking skills in people experiencing mild memory problems, who also have early signs of alzheimer’s disease on a brain scan or a lumbar puncture test. “this group of people don’t benefit from alzheimer’s drugs, so this drink is one option to consider alongside regular exercise, avoiding smoking and eating a healthy, balanced diet to keep their memory sharp.” although souvenaid appears to have some promising results, there are most definitely some limitations to the research. \"this trial of souvenaid didn’t meet the success criteria that would be needed for developing new drugs,” added dr brown. “so we can’t be confident of the drink’s benefits.” to explain a bit further, the doctor said: “although there was less cognitive decline in people taking the daily drink over two years, the same number of people still went on to develop dementia as those who had a fake drink every day. “we certainly can’t conclude that the drink slows progression of alzheimer’s disease.” dr brown also has advice for those concerned about their memory.  “there are many causes of memory decline, including normal ageing, so it’s important people are investigated for underlying alzheimer\\'s disease before taking this medical drink, or any kind of treatment.” souvenaid is approved for people in the early stages of dementia and is available at pharmacies, or from nutricia at £3.50 for a daily dose. for those of you who are unsure whether or not you, or somebody you love, is beginning to suffer from early dementia, there are certain clues to look out for. the nhs lists common symptoms that may appear before a diagnosis of dementia is made. these include:  before starting a conversation with somebody you’re concerned about, the health body echoes the alzheimer\\'s society suggestion to ask yourself the following questions: recommendations include talking in a non-threatening, familiar place and taking plenty of time to talk things through. see today\\'s front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic daily express newspaper archive.',\n",

              " 'the world health organisation has postponed its decision about whether to classify the new wuhan coronavirus as a global health emergency. it wants to gather more information and will meet again at midday on thursday in geneva (late thursday night, australian time).  there’s so much we don’t know about the virus, which increases the level of concern from public health officials. we first heard about cases of pneumonia caused by a new virus in december from authorities in wuhan, china – a city of 11 million people.  what started as a cluster of 27 people with pneumonia – with common symptoms including fever, dry cough, chest tightness and difficulty breathing – has spiralled to 582 confirmed cases, including medical staff, and 17 deaths.  the cases span 13 provinces in mainland china as well as thailand, japan, south korea, the united states, taiwan and macau. this is all occurring during peak influenza season in china so there are some illnesses around that may appear similar to coronavirus. it’s also a time when millions of people in the region travel home to family for lunar new year celebrations, potentially carrying the virus to new places, as we’ve already seen. we are yet to see a confirmed case in australia, but that could change any minute. test results of a brisbane man who was suspected of having the virus came back clear.  china was extraordinarily efficient and open in identifying the virus, a new strain of coronavirus, within just over a week. chinese scientists sequenced the virus’s genetic code and, within days, shared that information with the world.  this allowed researchers from germany to rapidly develop and openly share a suite of specific nucleic acid tests that sensitively identify the virus by detecting small amounts of its ribonucleic acid (or rna, similar to dna). researchers in hong kong and from the chinese centre for disease control then published their own different tests.  four other human coronaviruses (hcov-229e, hcov-oc43, hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1) cause colds, flu-like illnesses and more severe respiratory diseases such as pneumonia. viral pneumonia is a combination of virus infection of the lungs and our body’s immune response to that damage.  newborns, the elderly, immunocompromised people and those with underlying disease are at particular risk.  there are also two more infamous coronaviruses that jumped from animals to infect human hosts: sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and mers (middle east respiratory syndrome).  the new wuhan coronavirus seems to cause less severe disease than the sars coronavirus, which is now extinct after its single dramatic outbreak in 2002-4.  mers was less severe than either, unless the patient was already burdened with underlying disease. mers continues to transmit from camels to humans, but it’s relatively easy to avoid infection and vaccines are in development.  because we are at such an early stage of discovery and characterisation of the new wuhan virus, it’s very difficult to compare it to other viruses or to draw any strong conclusions about how it transmits, and its impact on humans. we don’t know where the new virus came from originally. we think it originated in animals, but testing so far has not confirmed a specific animal host. analysis of the genome suggests it has only recently emerged in humans. so which host were humans exposed to? and how was it transmitted to humans? once we know where it came from we can track down and remove the source of the virus. some evidence suggests it can also spread between people. we don’t yet know how, but we can make some guesses.  it seems to be a respiratory virus, given the disease primarily involves the lungs, so it’s likely to spread through the same routes as colds and flu: sneezes and coughs propelling droplets into the air or onto hands that then touch other surfaces, or by touching our eyes, nose or mouth after contact with contaminated surfaces.  we also don’t know how easily it spreads. initially it seemed to require prolonged and close contact, making it harder to catch in day-to-day life. however, there are more recent indications that it spreads more easily between people. up to january 22, 17 deaths have tragically occurred from 582 cases (about 3%). this is lower than the proportion who die from influenza-associated pneumonia, which one study estimated to be 10%. it’s a crude comparison, but one we can at least mull over for now.  the number of virus cases is likely to be an underestimate, but we don’t know by how much.  at the moment, colds and flu-like illnesses are common in china. there are also many causes of viral pneumonia – 135 people with pneumonia arrived in hong kong from wuhan between december 31 to january 22. to date only two cases have tested positive for the new virus; most had an influenza virus or other viruses. so far, we know the new wuhan coronavirus causes pneumonia and therefore places an extra burden on hospitals. it’s likely transmitting from human to human, but may also still be transmitting from animal to humans. and it can be tested for by professional laboratories.  for now, health authorities are ensuring we are prepared and watching the situation while we await further details.  if or when it does come to australia, you can protect yourself in the same way as you would against other respiratory illness: by being vigilant about hand-washing and practising good cough and sneeze etiquette, which means coughing or sneezing into your flexed elbow or into a tissue, and washing your hands.',\n",

              " 'in closing off wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people, china deployed on thursday morning a centuries-old public health tactic to prevent the spread of infectious disease — this time, a mysterious respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus. experts said the stunning scale of the shutdown, isolating a major urban transit hub larger than new york city, was without precedent. “it’s an unbelievable undertaking,” said dr. howard markel, a professor of the history of medicine at the university of michigan, adding that he had never heard of so many people being cordoned off as a disease-prevention measure. still, “people are going to get out,” he said. “it’s going to be leaky.” by thursday evening, china said it planned to extend the shutdown even further. officials said they would impose travel restrictions on at least four other nearby cities — huanggang, ezhou, chibi and zhijiang — affecting millions more residents. by limiting the movements of millions of people in an attempt to protect public health, china is engaging in a balancing act with a long and complicated history fraught with social, political and ethical concerns. james g. hodge jr., director of the center for public health law and policy at arizona state university, said the shutdown would almost certainly lead to human rights violations and would be patently unconstitutional in the united states. “it could very easily backfire,” he said, adding that the restrictions could prevent healthy people from fleeing the city, perhaps exposing them to greater risk of infection. “in general, this is risky business.” to combat the spread of the virus, which first appeared at the end of december and has killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 600, the chinese government said it would cancel planes and trains leaving wuhan beginning thursday, and suspend buses, subways and ferries within it. in huanggang, a city of seven million about 30 miles east of wuhan, residents would not be allowed to leave the city without special permission, according to a government statement. in ezhou, which has about one million residents, all rail stations were to be closed. the practice of isolating people and goods to halt the spread of disease dates at least to the 14th century, when ships arriving in venice during the plague epidemic were required to anchor off the coast for 40 days. the isolation period gave rise to the term quarantine, from the italian quaranta giorni, meaning 40 days, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. professor hodge said quarantines could be effective if they selectively isolate only those who have been infected or are suspected of infection. the response in wuhan, with the establishment of a “cordon sanitaire”-type boundary, goes much further than that. “quarantine would be saying ‘you can’t leave your own home, can’t go to school, work or church,’” he said. but the chinese authorities “have drawn a line around this city and said, ‘no one in and no one out.’ that type of thing is obviously an excessive response.” in recent years, governments have imposed other large-scale measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. sierra leone, a country of about seven million people, said “everybody” was expected to stay indoors for three days in september 2014, as 7,000 teams of health and community workers went door to door to find hidden ebola patients. earlier that year, liberian officials placed west point, a sprawling slum in monrovia where 60,000 to 120,000 people were crammed into shacks, under an ebola quarantine. the order led to deadly clashes with soldiers and may have helped to spread the disease, experts said, forcing people to crowd together for basic humanitarian aid. updated june 12,

microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. but a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. the best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. so far, the evidence seems to show it does. a widely cited paper published in april suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. recently, a top expert at the world health organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,”  but she later walked back that statement. a study by european scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. having type a blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. the unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in may, the labor department said on june 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in april, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after world war ii. but the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in april. mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across america are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. while many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. american adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in march than they were in january. but there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. first, “start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before covid,” says dr. monica rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the shirley ryan abilitylab in chicago. thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “when you haven’t been exercising, you lose muscle mass.” expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. but sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home. states are reopening bit by bit. this means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. the federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. even if you aren’t being told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. the c.d.c. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. if air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. most important: wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. if possible, choose a window seat. a study from emory university found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. disinfect hard surfaces. when you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees fahrenheit or higher. if you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of covid-19 complications. the c.d.c. has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. until now, the c.d.c., like the w.h.o., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. if you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. they should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. if you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the c.d.c. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. they will decide if you need to be tested. keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. during the sars outbreak of 2003, canadian health officials asked anyone in ontario who had even one symptom of the respiratory infection to stay home for a few days out of fear that the disease might spread during the easter holiday weekend. in beijing, at least 4,000 residents who had been exposed to the virus were kept in isolation, and 300 college students who had had contact with infected people were sequestered in a military camp for two weeks. historians have noted that quarantines have often targeted marginalized populations. during the plague epidemic of the 14th century, european city-states posted armed guards on roads and access points to keep out merchants, people with leprosy and minority groups such as jews, according to eugenia tognotti, a researcher in italy who has written on the history of quarantine. and during a wave of cholera outbreaks in europe in the 1830s, naples restricted the movement of prostitutes and beggars, who were thought to be carriers of the contagion, she wrote. russian jews brought typhus fever into the lower east side of manhattan in 1892, dr. markel said. it was not only infected people who were rounded up and quarantined on an island off the bronx, however, but also their neighbors and others whom they had simply greeted on the street. “that’s the darker side of quarantine — its misuse as a social tool rather than its scientific use as a medical tool,” dr. markel said. mihir zaveri contributed reporting.',\n",

              " 'wuhan, china — the authorities drastically expanded a travel lockdown in central china on thursday, essentially penning in more than 35 million residents to contain a deadly virus that is overwhelming hospitals and fueling fears of a pandemic. the new limits — abruptly decreed ahead of the lunar new year holiday, china’s busiest travel season — were an extraordinary step that underscored the ruling communist party’s deepening fears about the outbreak of a little understood coronavirus. it has killed at least 26 people and sickened more than 800 in china and at least six other countries, including the united states, according to statistics from health officials. in wuhan, the hubei provincial capital of 11 million where the outbreak began, anxiety and anger prevailed as worried residents crowded into hospitals and teams of medical workers in hazmat suits sought to identify the infected. “they can’t take proper care of all the people here,” said sun ansheng, a man in his 50s who was waiting outside a hospital while his wife was tested for the coronavirus, so named because of the spiky halo around the microorganism. “the city government told us there was a virus, but they didn’t explain enough what we should do,” mr. sun said. “they left it sounding too minor. now look.” even as the chinese authorities imposed the new restrictions — blocking expressways, cutting flights and warning residents to stay put — experts warned that the country risked a repeat of the sars epidemic, which broke out in china in late 2002 and spread for months while officials played down its severity. the updated death toll, announced early friday by chinese officials, jumped by more than a half-dozen in 24 hours. the world health organization’s emergency committee, meeting in geneva on thursday for the second consecutive day, said it was too early to declare an international health emergency though it would reconvene in 10 days or less to reassess the outbreak. the images in wuhan offered a jarring contrast to the attempts by chinese leaders in beijing to project confident composure. president xi jinping led a toast in an ornate hall in beijing to the lunar new year, which begins on saturday, and he did not mention the crisis in his remarks to the cheerful crowd of officials and guests. even so, a sense of anxiety was deepening across china, with hospitals scrambling to cope with an influx of possibly infected patients and people lashing out online at the government. in beijing, officials announced that they would temporarily close the forbidden city. on thursday morning, the authorities imposed a travel lockdown in wuhan, the industrial city at the epicenter of the outbreak. airlines canceled hundreds of flights to wuhan, leaving thousands of people stranded. later in the day, officials said they would also halt public transportation in the nearby cities of huanggang, ezhou, zhijiang and chibi, which are together home to more than nine million residents. and by friday, restrictions had extended to xiantao and qianjiang, two other cities that include large rural populations. “this was a very difficult choice,” wang xiaodong, the governor of hubei province, which includes wuhan and the other locked-down cities, told chinese state television. “although wuhan has taken a series of measures to ease things, there are certainly many hardships.” an announcement friday in the hubei daily, the province’s official newspaper, indicated that the restrictions could vary from city to city. in zhijiang, one of the cities listed, shops and businesses were ordered to close, except for supermarkets, food markets, and other ones essential for daily life. some residents in wuhan spoke speculatively of trying to skirt the blockade by driving on rural back roads to evade police checkpoints. “it’s serious, but not that serious,” said wang mengkai, a worker in an electronics parts factory who was stuck at the wuhan railway station, hoping to figure out a way to join his family in henan province for the lunar new year celebrations. “if we can’t get out on a train, we’ll try putting together a car with a driver,” he said. anger and frustration spread among wuhan residents lined up at hospitals seeking diagnosis and treatment for coughs and fevers. most residents interviewed said they could see the logic of travel restrictions. but many accused officials of having failed to ensure that enough medical workers were properly trained, while medical workers reported shortfalls of critical protective gear such as masks and goggles. “i’m willing to accept that we have to stay in wuhan, o.k., but the medical care needs to keep up,” said yang lin, 28, who had come seeking treatment for what she described as a cold. “you shouldn’t tell us we can’t leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. that’s unfair.” several residents said they had gone from hospital to hospital and lined up for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment if symptoms persisted. doctors told some patients of insufficient hospital beds and testing kits. some residents worry officials are underreporting the number of people ill with the virus, although the government has warned of dire consequences for those who hide or delay reporting cases. “the government did not fulfill its duty,” du hanrong, 56, a retiree, said by telephone. “they just are doing things hastily and carelessly.” the wuhan city government acknowledged that crowds were forming at hospitals, and it came under intensifying criticism from scientists and the public, who described the response as too little, too late. experts said that the mass travel restrictions, while understandable, would do little to stop the spread of the virus outside china, as many infected people had already left wuhan. “the horse is already out of the barn,” said dr. w. ian lipkin, an epidemiologist at the mailman school of public health at columbia university, who had assisted the chinese authorities in the response to sars. in an unusually blunt rebuke, dr. guan yi, a prominent hong kong scientist who also assisted in the sars crisis, said officials had obstructed his efforts to investigate the outbreak during a trip to wuhan this week. “i consider myself a veteran in battles,” he said in an interview published thursday by the influential magazine caixin, citing his experience with bird flu, sars, and other outbreaks. “but with this wuhan pneumonia, i feel extremely powerless.” on thursday, in what experts described as a somewhat reassuring sign, the chinese authorities released details about 18 of the people who had died in the outbreak, showing that the disease has so far largely killed older men, many with underlying health problems. but the 18th victim was the first to have died hundreds of miles from the wuhan epicenter, punctuating the risk of fatal cases far from where the virus was first reported. experts said the severity of the outbreak would depend on whether other epicenters develop, as happened during the sars crisis. but they acknowledged that much remains unknown, including how easily the new virus spreads between people. wuhan sits astride the mighty yangtze river, and the restaurants and hotels along its banks — usually busy in the holiday season — were mostly shut. retail streets were desolate, and the roads were often eerily empty. but cars crowded around seven hospitals across wuhan that have been designated as reception points for residents with high fevers that may have been caused by the new coronavirus. some people waiting outside clinics in a drizzly rain said that their family members had lined up for much of the day to be checked by a doctor. after sars broke out nearly 20 years ago, the chinese government took steps to improve its public health system, including monitoring infectious diseases. but the lingering public distrust created by cover-ups of sars and other health threats appears to have undercut those achievements. updated june 12, 2020 touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the

              " 'a new disease arrives in a chinese winter – is history repeating itself? at the end of 2002, sars erupted in the southern chinese province of guangdong. nearly two decades on, another new virus has struck at roughly the same time of year, this time in the central chinese city of wuhan. though the diseases are similar – sars and the new wuhan virus are from the same coronavirus family, and both attack the lungs – there is a great deal of difference in the way china has responded to these outbreaks. in 2002, china was in denial and concealed the existence of sars not merely from the outside world but from its own people. newspapers were forbidden from reporting the disease, except for occasional statements from government officials assuring the public that there was nothing to worry about. such was the obsession with suppressing “negative news” that when a sick traveller from guangdong arrived in beijing, doctors there had no idea of what the illness was, and allowed it to spread in the city. the people of guangdong, however, knew there was something frightening going on. nurses, doctors and healthcare workers were telling their friends and family they had never seen a disease that attacked so viciously and spread so rapidly. the provincial government’s aim in guangdong was simple: to stop local people from panicking and ensure that foreign investors and businesses were not scared away. guangdong had set itself a gdp growth target of 12.2%, and no disease was going to be allowed to stop the onward march of the economy. the cost of the chinese cover-up was immense, both in human lives as well as global standing. had china warned the world about this new disease and shared the considerable knowledge its doctors had already gained about its symptoms and its treatment, other countries would have been prepared and far fewer lives would have been lost. the fallout from china’s handling of sars forced a move towards greater openness that has been apparent in other outbreaks of disease. in the case of the wuhan flu, the world health organization as well as the public were informed on 31 december about the new disease. by early january, the virus had been identified as a coronavirus by chinese scientists, and its genetic sequence had been shared globally. both of these moves were essential for an effective global response to the disease. importantly, countries were aware of the disease before the first travellers brought it to their shores. the greater openness in china has done little to lessen the primeval fear experienced by people confronted with a new and largely unknown disease. virologists, clinicians and epidemiologists still know little about it, except that it is caused by a coronavirus, that the first cases appeared to be associated with a seafood market in wuhan, and that the number of cases seems to be rising steadily. it is unclear how severe the disease is. what proportion of people who get infected fall severely ill or die? is this a virus that primarily causes a mild illness in people, so that most people don’t even realise they have been infected, or is it a disease that hits hard, and sends most of those it infects to hospital? according to chinese authorities, 17 people have died since the virus was detected in late december, all in wuhan, and there have been 633 confirmed cases. the true numbers of those who have contracted the disease are likely to be much larger. there may be many more who have not gone to hospital because their symptoms are mild. we do not even know whether this disease kills more people than other common diseases such as influenza. china seems determined to see that it does not suffer the loss of image that happened after sars, and the unprecedented lockdown of 20 million people in wuhan and two neighbouring cities indicates that it is determined to quash this disease as firmly as it quashes political dissent. given the huge scientific uncertainties that exist, this may well be overkill. this is an animal virus, and according to who experts there is no evidence yet that it transmits easily and in a sustained way between human beings. there is also no guarantee that a lockdown will work to contain the virus. if it is indeed spreading fast and widely, then more and more cases are going to pop up all over the country regardless. the sars epidemic mysteriously disappeared in the summer of 2003, nine months after it arrived. unlike other diseases, it has never returned to the places that it once terrorised. no one knows why this is so. if china gets incredibly lucky, this new virus too could disappear. on the other hand, if the number of cases and deaths increase, china’s rulers could face something they fear more than disease itself: anger at a botched response and social discontent. • thomas abraham is the author of twenty-first century plague: the story of sars',\n",

              " 'financial markets around the world have been rattled by the coronavirus outbreak, with its centre in wuhan, a city known as the chicago of china for its central location and booming car manufacturing industry. amid growing concern over the spread of the virus, china has put wuhan and four other cities with a combined population of more than 20 million on lockdown. it has banned travel during the biggest mass annual human migration on the planet for the lunar new year this weekend, when up to 400 million chinese are expected to travel across the country to celebrate with friends and family. with outbound trains, buses and flights halted, fears are rising that the virus could also dent growth in the world’s second largest economy, in a rerun of the sars outbreak of 2003. the first major deadly infectious disease of the 21st century infected up to 8,098 people worldwide and killed 774, spreading fear of fatal disease around the world and dragging down chinese growth. almost two decades after becoming a member of the world trade organization, china is now far more important to the economic prospects of companies and countries worldwide. as fears of a “black swan” event rise at a fragile time for the world economy, there was a sharp sell-off on thursday, with markets in hong kong, shanghai and shenzhen down 2-3.5%. on the london stock exchange, mining companies including rio tinto, glencore and anglo american were among the biggest fallers, amid fears that demand for metals and materials in china could falter. the price of oil fell on international markets by 3%, while shares in hotel groups, airlines and luxury retailers – including louis vuitton, gucci and cartier – have all hit reverse. the lunar new year on 25 january is typically a significant opportunity for european luxury brands. china represents 35% of global income in the sector, and analysts warned sales could be dented by the travel bans during the crucial two-week spending period. christopher wood, an analyst at the us bank jefferies, said the virus had potential to trigger further panic-selling, adding: “markets have started to try to price in the risk of this becoming a full-blown epidemic.” if not contained, economists said tourism, retail sales and travel would be hit in the next few months, while industrial production could struggle to recover after a slump at the end of 2019, amid the us-china trade war which has cut chinese economic growth to its lowest level in 29 years. george magnus, an associate at the china centre at oxford university, said: “it’s coming at a very sensitive time for the chinese economy. it looked as though at the end of 2019 the downturn in economic activity and unemployment had stabilised. “the idea was that we would see a modest rise in economic growth in the first and second quarters of the year. that might not actually happen. it may cause stagnation around current levels of activity to continue.” wuhan is home to dongfeng, one of china’s largest car manufacturers. as the capital and most populous city of the central province of hubei, with a population of about 11 million, it produced roughly $224bn (£171bn) in gdp in 2018. while equivalent to the size of vietnam or portugal, it is little more than 1% of china’s total economic output. drawing lessons from the sars outbreak, economists at the french bank société générale warned that economic growth would probably fall below 6% in the first quarter of 2020, down from a previous estimate of 6.1%, if the outbreak failed to stabilise by march. consumer- and tourism-related sectors would be most affected, it said. sars caused an estimated decline in china’s gdp growth of between one and two percentage points, at a time when the country’s economy was much smaller but faster growing at the turn of the millennium. unlike the wuhan coronavirus, sars first hit the much more economically significant province of guangdong and spread to beijing – at a time when they accounted for a total of about 15% of gdp. according to société générale, sars caused visitor numbers to mainland china to plunge by 26% in the second quarter of 2003 from the previous three months, and by nearly 60% in guangdong. disruptions to normal production led to shortages of some products, including medicines. however, as the spread of the disease was contained, the disruption to activity was short-lived. a strong recovery followed, raising hopes that the coronavirus may also have little lasting impact if it can be contained. seema shah, the chief strategist at the fund manager principal global investors, said memories of the impact could play havoc with market confidence, but should be kept in perspective. she added: “it is too early to assess the potential economic impact of this outbreak. however, there is reason to hope that the impact of this virus will not be greater than sars. china’s response has been considerably more proactive than in 2003.”',\n",

(and, well, a third big problem is that they have been super expensive.) i have no idea when the fragility thing will be fixed, but i like that microsoft isn’t bothering with a flexible display. it compromised on whiz-bang hardware to make something more durable and, in many ways, elegant. but the trade-off is that there’s a big ol’ seam between the duo’s two screens. that’s the cart. the horse, then, is how the software is designed to deal with that trade-off. (this is a bad metaphor because i don’t know what goes in the cart but we’re in too deep to turn back now.) the details of microsoft’s answer to “how does android work on a dual-screen device” all seem really smart. windows central’s zac bowden installed the emulator and made a little video showing how windows move around and it’s refreshingly simple. apps open on a single screen, you go into the multitasking view and drag them to move them across to the other screen, or you move them over the seam for some kind of split-screen. there are different ways to split-screen: sometimes there’s a list on one side and details on the other, sometimes there’s two pages like on a book, and sometimes the canvas covers the whole thing and you just have to deal with the seam. all that is fine, but it’s not the smart part. just because microsoft appears to have created an elegant sdk doesn’t mean that anybody will actually use it. we’ve seen microsoft try and fail to woo mobile developers before. rip windows phone, we still miss ya. but for the duo, it’s even worse than that. we’ve watched google struggle to get android developers to make better big-screen layouts for their apps for years to disappointing results. android tablets have gone the way of the dodo and android apps on chrome os are best used in small doses. so the way microsoft appears to have dealt with that reality is one reason that i’m actually more hopeful today than i was yesterday about the duo’s chances. that’s because even if literally nobody customizes their android apps for the duo, it should still work pretty well. instead of pinning the duo’s chances on the nearly impossible task of getting android developers to invest resources in a completely new and untested phone, microsoft is working with where the ecosystem is today. the key reason is that microsoft explicitly says that apps will only open on one screen by default and in fact, apps will not be allowed to open up on both screens — that can only happen if a user drags a window into that state. your app by default will occupy a single screen, but users can span the app to cover both screens when the device is in a double-portrait or double-landscape layout. you can programmatically enable full-screen mode for your app at any time, but spanning is limited to user activity for now. it has the very practical benefit of working better with existing android apps by default. instead of being annoyed that many apps are kind of junky and poorly-designed in a tablet screen context, the entry experience will just be two normal android apps, side by side. android apps generally look alright on portrait, phone-style screens — and that’s the way they’ll launch on the duo. so even in the worst case scenario where only microsoft’s own apps are aware of the hinge, the duo will still work. it’s like the theory of progressive enhancement (and graceful degradation) in web design, but applied to dual-screen android apps. it’s smart because, frankly, the worst-case scenario also happens to be the most likely scenario at launch. only allowing users to choose when to make apps span two screens adds a level of predictability that will be important for users to built up their intuitions for how things work on the dual-screen device. (side note: i have a whole rant about how there’s no such thing as “intuitive” design in software, it’s all learned.) assuming it all works, users won’t be forced to learn a whole series of gestures and layouts and grids and whatever. instead, they’ll just be able to move stuff around and let the software do the right thing. it is, pardon the alliteration, programmatically pragmatic. none of this guarantees that the duo will be any good or that my relative optimism will be rewarded. i’m just glad that microsoft isn’t setting the whole situation up for immediate failure from the jump. there’s simply very little chance that a ton of android apps will be customized for the duo’s dual screens for launch, but that hopefully won’t matter. speaking of things that aren’t guaranteed: windows 10x. the developer tools for that os are still forthcoming and the questions about how it will operate are much more numerous than for the duo. given how many pc manufacturers are waiting for that os for their foldables, the stakes for windows 10x are much higher. as tom warren noted yesterday, we should expect to see more at microsoft’s build developers’ conference in may. if there were ever a time for microsoft to be a little less hand-wavy about 10x, that will be it. the galaxy s20 is usually $1,000, but it’s now $800 at several retailers. b&h photo is offering an especially good deal in addition to the discount by including a 128gb microsd card and samsung’s galaxy buds truly wireless earphones with the purchase. vox media has affiliate partnerships. these do not influence editorial content, though vox media may earn commissions for products purchased via affiliate links. for more information, see our ethics policy. prices displayed are based on the msrp at time of posting. └ microsoft to force chrome default search to bing using office 365 installer in case you were feeling really good about the new microsoft working across platforms, here is a reminder that it still sometimes does crappy things. └ senator asks jeff bezos for more information on saudi-linked hack reading the bullet points in wyden’s letter really drives home how every successively revealed detail in this story is more eye-popping and mysterious than the last. └ alleged xbox series x photos show off the port selection no hdmi-in, yet another sign that microsoft isn’t trying to make the xbox the central hub of your living room. it’s the right call. this feels vaguely related to the idea of a hub but i’ll leave it to you to connect the dots: the more i look at this big box the more it feels like one of those old hp mediasmart home servers. └ motorola’s foldable razr will launch on february 6th after delay it’s still $1499 and it’s coming out just days before samsung is expected to announce its own flip phone. but when people think flip phone, they think razr, so motorola still has a good chance even though it’s up against a bigger company. a real question in my mind is how big this launch will actually be. will verizon, because it has an exclusive, try to make this a huge deal with tons of marketing? during the announcement, motorola acted supremely confident in the razr’s reliability and battery life. how much oomph gets put into the retail launch will say a lot about how real that confidence was. └ google publishes largest ever high-resolution map of brain connectivity └ google designed an envelope you can use to hide your phone from yourself └ amazon music passes 55 million customers as it chips away at spotify and apple music └ great interview by loren grush: nasa administrator on the year ahead: ‘a lot of things have to go right’ └ rapid global response to the new coronavirus shows progress made since sars nicole wetsman: by comparison, the sars virus emerged in november 2002, but it took until april 2003 for scientists to get a full genetic sequence. it took several months of disease spreading in western africa in 2013 before authorities determined it was caused by ebola. it took around a year to identify zika as the cause of illnesses in brazil in 2014 and 2015. └ how an experimental story about gender and warfare shook the sci-fi community incredible story about how we perceive each other online, how platforms like google affect that, how the platforms themselves can be affected by our actions, identity online and off... i could go on. even if you aren’t interested in the specific things i just mentioned, i bet that the way this piece tells the story of their collisions and interactions will suck you in.',\n",
              " 'it has been splashed all over the front pages of newspapers around the world for days. but the outbreak of coronavirus, which has left at least 25 dead and infected more than 800, has been largely missing from china’s major state-run media. friday’s front page of the people’s daily, the chinese communist party’s flagship newspaper, displayed only warm wishes for lunar new year’s eve from the president, xi jinping, as he attended a spring festival gala at the great hall of the people in beijing. news of the coronavirus outbreak has also been buried during prime time cctv news over the past two evenings, featuring as the fifth or sixth item on the daily 7pm bulletin. bill bishop, the washington-based author of the widely read sinocism newsletter, said that despite the lack of front-page coverage xi was “all in” in guiding efforts to control the outbreak. he said the clunky nature of the coverage was primarily a product of communist party protocol. “anything about the general secretary is always first, and the top leaders have a set of ritual meetings the week before the new year that always get top billing,” bishop said. “other cctv news programs are doing a lot of reporting, as are lots of other official media. “they can not show any signs of panic, so the party media efforts are around showing resolve, action and competence.” the lack of prominent display of the outbreak by the party-run media comes as outlets such as caixin, the country’s most open business news outlet, and others have been allowed to report more freely, giving some measure of transparency to the outbreak. caixin has a team of nine reporters in wuhan that are now under the general quarantine and cannot leave the city because of the transport stoppages. it’s global site in english reports that health authorities in china “have been grappling” with the outbreak of the virus which it says has spread to all provinces except tibet and qinghai. but its chinese site leads on gdp figures, with the outbreak relegated to fourth spot. “how unleashed caixin and other media are allowed to be will be more interesting over the next week or so,” bishop said. “they seem to have a latitude, a rarity in the xi era, but i wonder how much they can dig out before they get smacked down by the censors.”',\n",
              " 'the world health organization has called on the global community to work together to fight the new coronavirus that is causing an epidemic of viral pneumonia and deaths in china, but stopped short of declaring it a public health emergency of international concern. after the second day of meetings of the emergency committee, who’s director general, dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, said on thursday that nobody should assume there was no risk that it would become a dangerous global epidemic. “make no mistake, this is an emergency in china,” he said. “but it has not yet become a global health emergency. it may yet become one.” there have been 584 cases and 17 deaths reported to the who so far, tedros said, although reports from china confirmed an 18th death on thursday in hebei province – the first outside hubei province, where the outbreak began in the city of wuhan. chinese state television put the number of confirmed cases at 634 by thursday evening. all the deaths and 575 cases were inside china, which is where all human-to-human transmission of the virus had so far occurred, said tedros. “there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside china. that doesn’t mean it won’t happen,” he said. “we know this virus causes severe disease and can kill, although for most people it causes mild disease,” he added. a quarter of those who became ill had severe disease and most of those who died had underlying poor health, such as heart disease. there are many unknowns that need answers from the world’s experts who must work together, such as the source of the virus, how easily it spreads, the clinical features and its severity. the committee’s decision, he said, “should not be taken as a sign who does not think the situation is serious or that we are not taking it seriously. nothing could be further from the truth.” peter piot, a professor of global health and the director of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, said the outbreak was at a critical stage and international collaboration and more resources were vital to stopping it in its tracks. “there are still many missing pieces in the jigsaw puzzle to fully understanding this new virus, which is spreading rapidly across china and most probably around the world. over the coming days and weeks we will know much more, but there cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action,” he said. “the good news is that the data to date suggest that this virus may have a lower mortality than sars. we have a diagnostic test and there is greater transparency than decades gone by. and that is essential because you cannot deal with a potential pandemic in one country alone.” anxieties in the uk and around the world are already running high. the scottish government said five people were being tested for the novel coronavirus. the prime minister boris johnson’s spokesman said that the tests were “purely precautionary”. prof jürgen haas, head of infections at the university of edinburgh, said he expected there would be many more suspected cases following those in scotland that emerged overnight. “the situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all uk cities with a large number of chinese students. it’s not too surprising. my suspicion is that there will probably be many more cases in many other cities in the uk. none of the cases i know of have been confirmed.” the virus has a long latency of between five and 14 days when there are no symptoms. haas said the testing would be done by public health england. the scottish government confirmed that the patients had been in wuhan recently. “following travel to wuhan, china, two people confirmed as diagnosed with influenza are now being tested for wuhan novel coronavirus as a precautionary measure only. three further people are also undergoing testing on a similar precautionary basis,” said a government spokesman. “there are currently no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the uk and the risk to the scottish public remains low.” he said they had “robust arrangements to manage emerging diseases and are monitoring this situation closely”. they would update the information further only if they had any confirmed cases, he added. belfast’s royal victoria hospital was also said to have a patient who was being tested for the new coronavirus, but the belfast health trust refused to comment. universities with large numbers of chinese students said they were giving out information and advice, encouraging them to report any possible symptoms. dundee, which has a joint education partnership with wuhan university, said it had advised students to be careful with any packages they might receive from the city, especially if they contained food. the us centers for disease control warned citizens to avoid all but essential travel to wuhan, in line with the advice from the uk government, while egypt and turkey joined the growing list of countries introducing screening at ports for travellers arriving from china. there are no treatments available for those who fall sick, although chinese doctors will be trialling potential new drugs – particularly those already being tested for use in mers (middle east respiratory syndrome), which is a more lethal member of the coronavirus family. a programme has already been launched to speed up work towards a vaccine. cepi, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations, said it hoped to have a vaccine in clinical trials within 16 weeks.',\n",

              " 'as the coronavirus makes its way across the world from china, investors have tried to assess the potential toll on financial markets by looking at previous viral pandemics. analysts have specifically looked at how wall street has previously reacted to the spread of sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2002-04 as the pathogen bears a resemblance to the coronavirus. the virus’s victims have swiftly piled up, with 17 deaths and more than 600 cases confirmed by health officials , but  the coronavirus, so far,  still pales to the lethal sars which eventually left a death toll of about 800, mostly in asia. still, the comparison “offers useful food for thought,” said ian lyngen, head of u.s. rates strategy at bmo capital markets. see : coronavirus infections have more than doubled. here’s why the mysterious illness from china spreads so quickly the worst of the damage on financial markets during the outbreak of sars was contained to hong kong hsi, +2.38% and chinese stock-market indices 000300, +1.50% , but it did have a significant impact on the global safe-haven — u.s. treasurys, as panicked investors sought shelter in government bonds, he said. in the eight months after november 2002, when the first sars case was reported, the 10-year treasury note yield tmubmusd10y, 0.757% plunged as much as 80 basis points to hit a low of 3.07% in june 2003. a similar flight to haven assets has played out in the last few days. since tuesday when the first case of the coronavirus was reported in the u.s., the 10-year treasury yield tmubmusd10y, 0.757% has fallen more than 10 basis points to later trade at around 1.722% on thursday, tradeweb data show. it’s why lyngen feels a new record-low for the 10-year yield is in the cards this year. to do that, the benchmark yield would have to fall around 40 basis points to push below the 1.32% all-time floor established in june 2016. “and even if the latest viral worries do not directly inspire a break of 1.32%, they do serve as a reminder of the structural demand for treasuries during times of uncertainty,” he said. read : what the 2003 sars epidemic tells us about the potential impact of china’s coronavirus on oil and metals but others are more skeptical if only because previous viral outbreaks like zika left wall street largely unscathed. david lafferty, chief investment strategist at natixis, argues it would take a significant dent on the chinese and domestic economy for the bond-market to rally much further on the coronavirus. though treasurys could benefit from short-term surges in haven demand, it would take a more persistent change in economic growth and inflation rates, the fundamental determinant of government borrowing yields, to have a material effect, he told marketwatch. even if the economic impact in the u.s is likely to be limited, economists do see the potential for chinese consumers and tourism-related sectors to receive a drubbing in the coming months if beijing struggles to contain the virus’s spread, especially in the crucial new year holiday period when millions across the country will travel to meet with family. analysts at société générale estimate that if the coronavirus continues to remain a problem through march, china’s first-quarter gross domestic product growth could fall below 6% this year, shy of their current forecast of 6.1%.',\n",

              " 'as the coronavirus spreads , economists are looking for clues to what the deadly illness’s broader impacts could be. many have drawn comparisons to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars, outbreak of 2003, which also originated in china and infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800. while the outbreak of the coronavirus is still in the early stages, there is reason to believe that the economic impact might be somewhat muted when compared with sars. this is due both to the swifter response to the illness from chinese officials as well as advances in technology that can facilitate commerce even when travel is constrained. to be sure, economists still predict “significant downside risk” over the next two quarters, but there could also be differences in transmission, according to a wednesday note by j.p. morgan ’s haibin zhu . “the chinese government has taken serious action much faster this time,” zhu wrote. it took three weeks for the chinese government to notify the world health organization after the first case of the coronavirus was identified on dec. 8. by contrast, nearly three months passed from the time the government first identified sars on nov. 16, 2002, to when who was notified, leading to the government being criticized for withholding information. with the chinese government thought to be better prepared to handle an outbreak as the memory of sars is still recent, the impact may be “less severe,” zhu wrote. china’s gross-domestic-product growth averaged 10.5% in the four quarters leading up to china taking serious action to quell the sars outbreak, but plunged to 3.4% in the second quarter of 2003 as the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly. growth swiftly rebounded in the second half of the year as the health alert was removed by who, putting china’s economy back in line with previous years. but it isn’t just china’s relatively faster response this time that may mitigate an economic slowdown. the world economy has changed enormously over the past 17 years as more business is conducted online. online sales in china have risen 30% since 2014 and now account for 20% of total retail sales, up from zero to low single digits in 2003, by zhu’s estimate. while airlines, airports, and other public places are sure to see a drop in traffic as travel bans take hold and people avoid going out, online business may rise . e-commerce platforms such as         alibaba group holding (ticker: baba),         meituan dianping (3690.hong kong), and vipshop holdings (vips) could benefit, as could delivery companies such as zto express (zto) and best (best), zhu writes. write to carleton english at carleton.english@dowjones.com',\n",
              " 'in the past several weeks, a biting joke has been widely shared on chinese social media: the new coronavirus is patriotic, so it goes, because it infected only one of china’s 33 provinces and municipalities before venturing outside of the mainland. then, people this week woke up to official announcements of a shocking surge of confirmed new infections, and of the virus’s spread to more than a dozen provinces and municipalities. as of thursday, there are more than 550 confirmed cases, 17 people have died and wuhan, where the outbreak started, is on lockdown. beyond mainland china, thailand, japan, south korea, taiwan, the us and hong kong have confirmed cases, and more countries could report cases as china’s biggest travel seasongets underway: chinese lunar new year. people are panicking. when a new disease is discovered, it’s undeniably hard to identify and inform the public about it quickly. yet china is making the problem harder to solve, even though it should have learnedfrom the sars outbreak in 2003, when the government admitted to underreporting cases in the initial stages. nearly 800 people died in that epidemic, which sawdesperate people emptying shops for chinese herbal medicinesand vinegar that would turn out to be ineffective. that frenzy was driven by the lack of accurate information and rumors because of a vacuum in top-down communication. the idea of wei wen, or maintaining stability in china’s political system made “conceal as many as possible and keep it at the local level” a natural immediate response to a crisis like this. that approach to information might work on other kinds of issues, but not when it comes to a potential epidemic. trying to control information in that case becomes a kind of shackle in the face of something that can progress and change swiftly beyond one’s control. of course, there is one thing that’s different than 17 years ago: wechat. a tool connecting more than a billion users in china should be one the government can use to help keep the public up-to-date, and to debunk false information. yet it too hasbecome a hotbed for both rumors and information suppression amid china’s broader regime of online censorship honed over the past decade. already, a focus of social media discussion about the current virus crisis has been on how hard it’s been to get correct information, and whether officials were slow to respond in the early stages, at least in wuhan. while some international public health experts have commended china’s information sharing as superior to 2003 in the face of a quickly evolving situation, others have expressed doubt that the country is being as transparent as it should be. this month, almostas soon as the first local municipal health statement was issued (link in chinese) about a cluster of cases of pneumonia in wuhan,in central china, police detained eight local people for “spreading rumors about pneumonia.” ittook several weeks for authorities to adopt precautions like measuring body temperature with infrared thermometers in highly-crowded public places such as train stations, noted a comment piece in beijing news (link in chinese), a local government-backed newspaper on tuesday (jan. 21).the public was also puzzled by how to understand the authorities’ communications about the likelihood of human-to-human infections, an indication that an infection can spread more quickly and be more dangerous, with authorities saying the risk of such transmission was “limited” and low, then later confirming that such infectionswere taking place. an interview in 2017 with jiang yanyong, the whistle-blower of china’s sars coverup, that resurfaced two days ago on wechat goes to the heart of what people worry about most. in it, the expert argued that china has suffered too much from information control, recalling how a big beijing hospital dodged checks from the world health organization by putting patients in other departments of the hospital, instead of the respiratory or infectious diseases wing. in another popular article, a doctor at a beijing hospital claimed he had observed his hospital putting 29 patients in ambulances to dodge the checks during sars. now both posts are no longer available because of “violation of regulations” a reason often used as an excuse to delete what authorities deemed as sensitive, even though the information may be accurate and valid. it might be that the doctor’s claim was unverified or untrue.but it’s hard to tell whether authorities want to suppress incorrect information or merely to try to contain fear. either way, it increases mistrust of the authorities at the time they most need the public’s trust. for example, it was only when zhong nanshan, the 83-year-old respiratory expert who iswidely-recognized as a medical hero of the sars outbreak, appeared on china’s state broadcaster on tuesday (jan. 21), that people came to know three key pieces of information–the fact that 14 healthcare workers been infected, the fact that the disease can spread from human to human, and that wearing masks helps.zhong’s comments, which circulated all over wechat and microblog platform weibo, seemed to inspire more trust than those from the authorities, since he is known for questioning official statements during the sars outbreak and during subsequent outbreaks of infectious disease. articles questioned why the local health commission in wuhan hadn’t been more forthcoming about the medical workers’ infections. these questions aren’t shaped only by missteps 17 years ago. there are many examples of more recent cover-ups as well, such as the 2008 baby milk powder case which killed six babies and left many sick. ten years later, people still refrain from buying milk powder made in china. a top government body has warned that any party member who conceals information this time will be “nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity.” but in a system where people feel constantly tricked and puzzled by the discrepancies in the information they get, over time the public tends not to believe in anything the government says—and to disbelieve its representatives are acting in good faith. “all of those who have received a good education in china know from deep down in their heart that the biggest fear brought by sars and wuhan pneumonia is the uncontrollable behavior of the bureaucratic class,” said a weibo post commenting on zhong’s interview, “china has the world’s best 5g and high-speed train technology, but in some aspects of governing, china is still in the middle ages.” this essay was first published on medium.',\n",
              " 'if wuhan could be compared to an american city, it might be pittsburgh — a much bigger, much hotter pittsburgh. wuhan, an industrial city in central china, straddles a river, the yangtze. it is home to a troubled and declining steel industry. it is a university town filled with college students. the comparisons don’t go much further. wuhan has a population of more than 11 million people, the equivalent of 36 pittsburghs. in terms of college students alone, roughly one million are enrolled there, according to government figures. summer temperatures can approach 100 degrees, with heavy humidity. its traditional dish, and one of china’s favorite noshes, is a pungent pasta concoction called reganmian, or “hot dry noodles.” wuhan is also the epicenter of a viral outbreak that is worrying the world. on thursday, chinese officials sharply limited travel to and from the city in an effort to contain a coronavirus that so far has killed at least 17 people and infected hundreds more. the restrictions hit the city at the peak of the travel period for the lunar new year holiday, meaning many residents may miss their families and loved ones this week. wuhan embodies china’s rise as a global economic power, in all its complexities. disposable income per person soared more than sixfold between 2002 and 2018, according to government figures compiled by ceic data, an information provider. the area is home to vast factories making cars for general motors, nissan, honda and other global and local brands. the city has become a popular destination for foreign investment. the chinese government thinks so highly of the city’s image that xi jinping, the country’s leader, met prime minister narendra modi of india there two years ago. the two walked along the city’s east lake, building what chinese state-run media came to call the wuhan spirit between the two regional rivals. the boom has come with problems. heavy pollution has provoked protests. wuhan’s streets are often clogged with traffic. its steel factories, long a backbone of the local economy, have struggled along with the rest of the inefficient industry in china with overcapacity and pollution problems, leading beijing to combine the state-owned local giant, wuhan steel, with another company. wuhan has long been a center of commerce in china thanks to its position along the yangtze river, a major trade route, and it remains a key transportation hub, leading some in china to compare it to chicago. it was also the site of one formative event in chinese history: a military mutiny in 1911 that led to the collapse of the qing dynasty and ushered in the republic of china. updated june 12, 2020 so far, the evidence seems to show it does. a widely cited paper published in april suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. recently, a top expert at the world health organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,”  but she later walked back that statement. touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. but it can happen. a number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals. but a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. the best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks. a study by european scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. having type a blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study. the unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in may, the labor department said on june 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in april, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after world war ii. but the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in april. mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people onto the streets in cities across america are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases. while many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus. some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. exercise researchers and physicians have some blunt advice for those of us aiming to return to regular exercise now: start slowly and then rev up your workouts, also slowly. american adults tended to be about 12 percent less active after the stay-at-home mandates began in march than they were in january. but there are steps you can take to ease your way back into regular exercise safely. first, “start at no more than 50 percent of the exercise you were doing before covid,” says dr. monica rho, the chief of musculoskeletal medicine at the shirley ryan abilitylab in chicago. thread in some preparatory squats, too, she advises. “when you haven’t been exercising, you lose muscle mass.” expect some muscle twinges after these preliminary, post-lockdown sessions, especially a day or two later. but sudden or increasing pain during exercise is a clarion call to stop and return home. states are reopening bit by bit. this means that more public spaces are available for use and more and more businesses are being allowed to open again. the federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. even if you aren’t being told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. the c.d.c. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days. if air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. most important: wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. if possible, choose a window seat. a study from emory university found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. disinfect hard surfaces. when you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. if the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.) taking one’s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as “normal” temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees fahrenheit or higher. if you don’t have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of covid-19 complications. the c.d.c. has recommended that all americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. this is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. until now, the c.d.c., like the w.h.o., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing. if you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. they should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. if you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the c.d.c. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. they will decide if you need to be tested. keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested. wuhan held a special place in the heart of mao zedong, who famously took a swim in the yangtze there in 1966 to show his vitality. this was at the beginning of the cultural revolution, which tore wuhan apart as it did other cities. as china took off in the modern era, local leaders tried to burnish the city’s image and show wuhan taking part in the country’s rise. they explored adopting a slogan and considered “great river, great lake, great wuhan” and “river capital of the east, livable wuhan,” among others. they settled on “wuhan, different everyday!”']"
